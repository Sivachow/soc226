"Hey, folks! Hello, everybody! Welcome to our
course on surveillance. First of all, this is the first time that i'm using the setup. Do you hear me? Do you see me?
I am going to try to change the slides, because you know i'm not very. I don't think i'm very clear in there. But
yeah, okay, you're okay, good.
So i'm happy to report that I am in Edmonton. So after over a year.
So it's it's it feels really good to come back home.
and I also like to apologize last. I couldn't. I couldn't do last class, either in person or to record it, because I was traveling, and it was too crazy, you know. But it's okay. I kind of predicted that. So if you go to our syllabus, you're gonna see that.
you know. Today we were supposed to be discussing a full call, Michelle, for call, and next week we are our next class. On on Thursday we we are supposed to be discussing Delus, which is a French philosopher. Very good friends of with full call, by the way, and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna combine.
You know. I gave like one lecture for each, but i'm gonna combine them. And you're gonna say it's pretty fine, because, like the news is full calls. Reading is a bit heavy, but i'm going to break it down for you. But like this is reading is also heavy, but it's very short. So you know it's it's doable. So you know
it. It Won't really impact us. Okay. So
so first, do you? I? I would like to kind of give you a heads up.
I've I've been getting a lot of emails of people, Marcella. Where do I find the password to watch the lecture?
I would like you guys to share in the chat. Where do you find the password? Because, like on my end.
I put a link
to the lecture on our class, and then like on the title of the lecture. I put the password. But like, are you guys using that, or you're or you're getting the password somehow through.
Okay. So so, Valencia, she says, it's okay. So you're getting to tie. Okay. So you're you're going by the title. Okay, that's fine. So. That's what i'm telling. People just read the title. You're gonna see that there is a password in there, you know I I wasn't I was. I was. I wasn't sure if you could actually find the password.
you know, on somewhere I don't know, like inside of zoom, or your zoom account, I don't know.
Okay, that's fine. Okay, so this is good. Thank you guys very much for sharing that. So okay, okay. So this is, I think this is this, is it. There's one classmate of yours
This person shared with me a very nice Ted Talk which covers I didn't. I didn't watch the whole Ted talk Yet I I start watching, but it just like Pause me the way i'm gonna finish tonight. But it's a nice set talk that talks about. You know the the take home messages from last week.
Our tools from just get here next week.
So here, if you remember well.
we have.
See where that is.
Just get my slides. It's just easier
within a second. Hold on a second, please.
If you go to the end of my slides last week. Okay, the end of them. So what we have in there is.
Let's see where that is.
I asked you to read
lessons. Okay, so
no, no, not that. Hold on a second.
or is it
okay? Here it's like, If you go to my last week's presentation slide set slide 28.
You're gonna seen there. The 10 big ideas. Obviously you can play that again. But the Ted Talk discusses some of those ideas, you know. So it's it's interesting for us to think further, but i'll share with you. I'll put on on the class for you. It's not for exam, or none of that is just in case you want to kind of think a deeper about surveillance. Okay.
So
also I would like to let you know, in case you have some nice materials that you want to share with me and your classmates.
Just send it. Send them away, because, you know there's there's a lot of materials today about surveillance. So if if there's anything that Co. Catches your eye, and you kind of all this is really interesting. Please share with me, and then i'll share for everybody else.
And or if if you don't want to share for everybody else, just let me know ourselves. This is just for you, you know, whatever that is, just share, I mean because there's a lot of nice resources.
Okay, so do you have any questions anything that you were concerned about? Please let me know here before I start, and then we're gonna jump right into the text.
Okay, let me just as you think. Let me just share my slides with you. I'm going to post them
as soon as we are done.
because sometimes I make little edits about so as we are done here
I am gonna
I'm gonna i'm gonna post up to you.
Let me know.
Oh.
do you see me or no
people?
Okay, do you see? Like okay, Great can? Do you see the full screen like the big screen, or, you see, because right now I just have to. I don't know. For some reason I have 2 screens. Do you just see my screen, or you see me, or what do you see? Exactly.
Okay.
Just try to share this. I'm gonna share, because something went for only here
because we're supposed to see my slides, and then me
right like i'll decide
20 funny
new set up new life, so it's kind of things are a little bit so weird to your my end.
Hey? Do you see me now? And okay, you you you guys tell me if you don't see my slides.
Do you see?
Sorry, I just will bug you one more time. But you you're supposed to see my screen in my face. You're not supposed to see my notes, although I don't have any notes. But, like you're not supposed to see my notes. Is that what you've seen there? My screen in my face?
Okay, great. So we are all good to go right like. Okay. So let's go, then.
Okay. So that's so. The way
Dr. Haggardy and I the way that we organize. This course is
first. We have this intro for you, which I gave last week, right like. So, being through kind of just to kind of get you going just to kind of make you think about surveillance. So we came. We met. We discussed a syllabus. Then I gave you a like I'm. Through the introductory kind of lecture. And so today, what I am going to give you is is some the main purpose today. The main the main goal of today's lecturer. Please take note of that. The main goal of today's lecture is for you to kind of
walk away from here with some elements for you to start to theorize surveillance. Okay, so just like basic elements for you to start kind of all this type of surveillance is this type there? This other kind is another kind. So it's almost like you being able to differentiate
different types of surveillance. And before we go
to this like and start this lecture I would like to remind you of something very important. You got to remind surveillance about data collection is about monitoring, but you also want to remember you know, like the my pre-recorded for you. That surveillance is also about governance. When you do surveillance on someone or something, you do it because you are trying to govern someone's or something's life. So you're trying to govern behavior outwardly. That's why we do surveillance.
and that's why there's a lot of people in both science here, because it's about like. If you want to understand governance.
you've got to think about how data is collected, how how we classify populations. It can be populations of people or animals, or whatever. How we classify things as society, how we govern, how we use those classifications to govern the way that people behave. Okay. So if you have any comments, I I have the chat here right in front of me, you know.
Yeah, just put on the chat balance. At least, if you have a question, just throw in there. I'm gonna i'm gonna keep i'm gonna keep checking the chat, you know. So you know, just putting there. Okay, so and also feel free to kind. If you guys see that i'm kind of switching gears
and and you know, when I didn't see the chat to say myself, Chat, please, you know. And then I checked the check, because sometimes I may forget. Okay. So again. So remember this, I beg you you have to keep that in mind, because if you don't keep that in mind, that surveillance is about governance that ultimately the purpose of surveillance is to govern on a very micro level.
It can be me and you or it can be me and the entire class, or it can be me in the country, or it can be me and all the clients, the consumers. I mean, it's about to offer. So keep this in mind. Okay, yeah. Some. You post the slides. Jenn: yeah, Thank you for your question right after. Why, I don't. I'm gonna actually
I should start doing it first of before class. The only fear that I have is that sometimes I do. I make little change. I find some little titles or someone makes a comment, and I I bet that in this line, and then, you know, let's here. Let's let's make a deal. Always start posting these lines before.
but then be aware that sometimes I do make some little notes to them. If you are in class you're gonna see me doing it. Oh, you know, because I say, if you watch classes say, oh, i'm gonna change this here. I'm gonna add this in here, but that's the only reason why I don't put before. But I understand it's easier for you guys if I put it earlier like, so you can have this line. You can type on it right. So i'm gonna start to do that.
anyway. So you're ready. So let's so. Oh, yeah. So before. So so here's just some very preliminary elements for you to kind of understand surveillance and and start to kind of differentiate different kinds of surveillance, and therefore different kinds of governance. Okay, and we are going to. We are going to start with the literature.
This is what I'm giving you today where it's the that they have readings that we're discussing today. They are not sociology or science or scientific. They are a literature. They are novels. So
look, we are going to start. I don't know why it's not
okay, not here. We go. So we're going to discuss George Orals fragments. We're going to discuss on those Huxley fragments, and we're going to discuss an interview with others. Huxley, Marcella, what the heck is this look. George world is a very fables novelist
for his Dystopian novel called 1984. Okay, so he was. The he was a writer of 1984, so I can't find. Yeah, it's not. It's not in there yet.
I but I like starting from next week I will put the slides in there for you. Okay, but it's not in there yet. So but so we're gonna discuss Jordan Laurel and a little bit of 1984.
I will like those Huxley.
I probably a lot of you. Probably most have you ever heard of those of of of George World in in 1984
just a show of hands in the chat. Yes, yes, Nope. Just just put in there. Yes. Nope. Nope. Yes, No. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of very popular, is if you Haven't heard. This is actually nice that you Haven't heard, because you're gonna hear. Now you're gonna go like. Oh, my gosh! This is interesting.
So this is a novel. I highly recommend you guys to read it. Okay, yeah, that's nice. You read like very brick 12. I highly recommend. I read this: I was very young. I was 14 or 15 to, you know, like the same age of some of you.
And but have you heard of those Huxley and his book.
The Brave New World. Let's see who did.
Yep. Yep. I believe that would be more nose. Let's see. Someone know. Yes, no. Okay. I see more those and that's exactly yeah, okay. You heard some people heard No, it's. It's so funny, because when we think about surveillance immediately week, it comes 1984. The book
and the big brother, the the big brother is the name is is the is is is a reference in the book 1984, and it is a synonym for the State.
So the State called Big Brother. Okay. So when I think surveillance we think Big brother we think 1,984. And interestingly, we don't think about adults, Huxley
people never but I mean even for me at the U. Of a. It took forever for me, I mean I always knew the book. I read the book also when I was very in the brave New World, the book by Huxley, and I remember me like many years ago, asking Dr. Hegery, my supervisor, like, Why, the heck you don't talk about
Huxley.
Because for me, Marcella
Huxley's book, the brave new world. It's much more interesting
for people who are interested in surveillance, and I asked him, Why, don't you talk about it? Because you know for me it's much more subtle, you know. It is exactly the the kind of surveillance that we have today society, and then he was like. Oh, I don't know it's just because the other one is more famous. People connect better, which is right, I mean, but this one for me it gives us
much more out, many more element or much more elements to think surveillance in our society today. Okay. So we're going to talk about a little bit about them, and then we're going to see an interview with on those Huxley. So let's go.
And again, so today it's just literature trying to get you kind of you know, like you're gonna like inspired. Okay. So just put some cover for you for those of you who never, you know, read the book or never heard about the book 1984, by George Will. Oh, Jordan World, One thing.
Look at this. This book. Here was published in 1949. Okay, 1984 was actually published in 1,949. Do you know is there any historical event that comes to mind? 1949?
Anything? Let's see the chat. Anything any historical event that rings the bell for 19, not 84, but 1,949. The data that the book was published.
Come on, people. Anybody here who has been to China or visit China. People in both science, who you know, steady Communist countries. I mean anything, rings the bell.
No, no, matthew it's not that the rise, the the the curtain. It was 89. Okay, the the the end of the carton was 89, so not that in 991 Republic of China. Oh, oh, someone, we just said Republic of Chinese, but it's not the Republic of China, it is the people
people's Republic of China.
So it is the Communist River, the end of the Communist revolution in China. Keep this in mind, not because I am interested in China, as you guys know by now, but because you're gonna see. I'm gonna draw a lot of comparisons with China, but not because of my interest, but because, you know, like, though that was kind of inspiring George Laurel. Okay.
Also, I should tell you that I should tell you that Jard War. Actually.
he was the student of adults, Huxley.
and it's so funny. So you know, AD those Hxley was a professor of of George Rural and and and the Brave New World. The other book that we're going to discuss. It came earlier. It came in 1932,
and it is, in my opinion it's much more sophisticated.
So it's so funny because we usually I expect my students to be better than that than what I am. I expect you guys to do better than what I do, and in in, you know, and to surpass me, and and to write better sociology and premiology and surveillance studies. But in that case here was the opposite, you know, like ironically, George Warren became much more famous.
You know he is the famous guy just turned his off. He is a famous guy, however, you know his like the students, is the famous, but in my opinion the prof is better. You know this shouldn't never surpass the pros. But anyways, let's let's keep going. So this is the the cover. Here's some context for you.
and feel free to add stuff on the chat. And and just so you know it's it's the end of the Civil War, which is the Co. Which was the Communist revolutions at the end in China. But anyways back to the book here.
So the the whole story is the story of Winston Smith, I mean. Well, he's the main character. He's the main character. Okay. And this guy. The the whole context is London. Okay?
And those 2 guys they were British, both George War and and also those Huxley. So they were British people. So like this this is, it happens in London and the name of the country it's called
so, I think, in English. As to or yeah, we'll see any Portuguese in English and that country that place, that that that society where I Smith, lived. It's always at war.
and and the party, the government. The State is the big brother. Okay. So in the like this, this this slogan here for this society is war is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
Think about this. Think about this slogan, I mean, how do you? How is that possible to reconcile warriors? Peace and freedom and slavery? Is slavery and ignorance is strength. I mean.
don't you guys find this weird, and and if you do find a weird kind of it that those things don't pair together right? There is a contradiction in here, and and that that contradiction it was part of the entire like, like the entire regime in which a sense, in in the sense that I mean things. They were contradictory
and and but they state, managed to say, No, no, this is what it is. This is what you See, there's no contradiction here. What you see is just, you know it's just conformity. It's all. It's all good. It's all. There's no there is no problem in here, and and
we're gonna talk more about that when we talk about the language. Okay. But keep in mind. You know this this slogan, also the political regime in this book was called
in Sock, which stands for English Socialism.
so like that society was a Socialist side. So we have George War trying to, you know, deep pipe, or or portray a Socialist society where we had a big, broader, very similar to China. You see. Like to. You know what how we see China here in the West. Okay, in terms of language.
that society had a new, entire new language which was called Neil Speak. Okay. So the assumption behind.
like this new society, where, you know, was a Socialist society, you know, that was called Oceania, and had that slogan, and and it had a new entire new dictionary, that the whole assumption was that for awards they do have power, and probably
you would agree with me, and that's why we we even in today's society we keep changing
words cause words they are molded. So let's let's think about racism. For example, there's an all a lot of words that we don't use them anymore, and they are considered like, like extremely like they're supposed to. They're considered like a
insulting and disrespectful. I mean, you know in in in the whole, you know, domain of racism, or even like other words like
you know, like, for example, we now have the word Lgbtq 2 plus a so it's a new, a new word for you know, for a new category of of gender and and sexuality. So so we keep changing that. Okay, but like in the but so why? I'm saying that because words they do have power
right? So words they cost you 5 people, so that government. So look, remember, surveillance is about data. Collection is about monitoring. So for you to monitor someone a very good way of monitoring someone's calling someone a name right? So even they can today society. So back to they changed the, to to the language, because they, you know, they create their whole new. They they created new speak or an entire new dictionary, because
these okay words, they have power. We want to take control of, of, of of society by controlling words that can and cannot be used right. So so, for example.
I don't know if you can see you cannot see my My, no. I left some notes for you some examples. Crime stopped crime stock.
you know. The meaning of that was not to stop crime or stop criminality, but was to kind of get read of any, get read of any thought that was wrong that was not in compliance with whatever the big, broader wanted you to think so. That was crime. Stop, so that you you're having this bad thoughts. What are bad thoughts thoughts that are not in compliance. And then you kind of make them go away, that making them go away. What's called crime stock.
So you had, for example, crime, think crime, think, was exactly to you. Think things that the party did not want you to think right. So double think double thing was to have, like, you know, to think.
contract like thoughts that they were con contradictory. They were like, you know they were in a position, and and they were true at the same time which it is the case. The case of that slogan. War is peace, and freedom is slavery, I mean.
I see a huge contradiction. War cannot be peace, and vice versa. Freedom cannot be slavery, and vice versa. Ignorance cannot be strength, and vice versa, but like but the parts I don't know
those things there they are the truth.
So like this idea of having contradictory kind of thoughts that they actually are true. There was a name for that that that was called double. Think. Okay. So when you're double, like just double think meaning, you know. Just go tag along with that, you know.
They also called the normal English olds pick.
so old speak, was just a normal English sex crime was any kind of sexual act that was done without the notation of procreation. So in this society sex was meant for pro procreation. And why was that? Because.
you know the party? They did not want people to have personal feelings like any kind of like personal, any kind of emotions
had to be regulated by the party. So if you're gonna hate you're gonna hate someone at the party told you to hate if you're gonna law, if you're gonna love someone that the party told you to to love so like, you know, it's so. Having sex.
you know, just for the sake of having sex that meant unregulated kind of emotions, so that what there was, you know, that was monitored, and data was collect on that on that.
and people were punished. Okay, so just kind of give you, you know. So the main character is this guy named Smith and Winston Smith, and he was an employee of the government. So he worked for the the Ministry of of Truth.
which was also called Mini. True. Okay, in in this, like New speak new speak was mean, true. So he worked for me, it true, and he was deviant. He was a deviant character. Why? Because he kept a diary.
which was something that the party did not allow. Because think with me when you were when you were keeping a diary. People
I don't know if I don't, if you ever. I mean I I have never had a diary. I mean, that's not really part of the Brazilian culture, but I know that here in Canada a lot of the kids and teenagers, and even adults. They're encouraged to kind of. You know you You keep. You have that habit.
and and but to keep a diary. That means that you are producing. You are collecting data on society. You are collecting data on your own life, and you're recording that data, and that
in Oceania only the State had the power to do so. You are not allowed to, you know, to produce your own records, to collect data about society, I mean, that was something that so? That was deviant. So he kept a drop diary. And and also
another thing was that you know he had. I mean, this is not in the the parts that I gave you. But like, if you read the book or watch the movie, you're gonna see that he falls in love with someone which is also not supposed to happen. So he was a very deviant character in the same, in the sense that he was broken the norms he was broken. The loss and he in his job was his job at the Ministry of Truth
was pretty much to edit information.
So we're gonna discuss them more, you know. But so far am I making sense to you? Because I mean, this is a dystopian. I'm trying to kind of give you context of a dystopian society that we're society where surveillance was strong. I mean, does it? It makes sense? I'm. Here in the chat, just checking. If you, if you guys are following okay, would you like to add anything so far?
You know anything that you know that for those of you who read, or those of you read like the book or the excerpts, or, you know, would like to add anything, feel free to do so. Okay, like.
So
look another thing. So let's let's go here. And okay, let's let's think about
the type of surveillance that take the type of data collection monitoring the type of governance that was common in that society of 1984. So when we think about, when we think about visibility
in terms of surveillance, if surveillance is the governance. Think about it! What? All those for us boxes that you see, they speak back to the type of surveillance, the type of data collection monitoring governance, so go like like like like like
governance in that society of 1,984
it was extremely visible, extremely visible. So all the time, you know you had like the big broader like you. Let's suppose you are working. I'm here teaching right now. I'm teaching you guys.
And then, all of a sudden the speaker there was a speaker somewhere here in the room, and this speaker would go like You know, Marcella, what your say is not quite like that, or you said something that should be corrected. I mean so. The big brother would interfere in my life or in your life in any kind of context could be that be private or public.
you know, because the big brother was this entity that had this.
like, you know, presence everywhere, and that that big brother would be true in your life, and tell you, you know, and tell you to apply yourself, or to you know, to rephrase what you just did so like what I just said. So surveillance. So take note of that surveillance. Governance monitoring was extremely, extremely extremely visible.
Okay, and yet you could say all. But the big brother was everywhere. Yeah, it was everywhere, but it made itself visible through by intruding in people's life all of a sudden. Let's suppose you in the book there are, like many, many situations where Smith is doing something like, you know.
like something like very from the daily life.
and that's that. I mean, I'm gonna make up something here like, you know you're cooking eggs, and then the big brother tells you you're not supposed to cook at this that way. You're supposed to do that in that I mean. So you know
so, and and and also surveillance
was, or you know, that book is external.
So there is this entity.
the big broader, you know, doing surveillance on you. So this entity doing surveillance on its subjects. We are the subjects. Smith is a subject, so so remember it's visible.
It's external Marcella what you're talking about. Surveillance surveillance is visible. Surveillance is external okay.
monitoring the monitoring that happens in that society which is
like one aspect of surveillance.
was forceful. It was extremely coerative. So if you don't do what I say, I catch you doing something wrong, and if you don't apply yourself, you are punished.
So people disappear. Anyone who does anything wrong, just the anyone that challenges the th the big broader the State disappears right, so that it's based on terror. So people are terrified, so that's pretty much the kind of monitoring that we have any kind of individuality
like any. Oh, I like this, or I prefer that that was banned.
You don't like anything. You don't prefer anything. You go with the the mess that the masses like the people, the population you do, whatever the Government tells you to do right, you go with everybody so.
and in terms of got. When we think strictly about like the way that the governance was done, was the and and also the surveillance through conflict. So there is always a figure of a position.
Okay, always a figure of a position. So an enemy that we have to kill an enemy that we have to. We go to war against, and then I mean that they could be the neighbor, someone who is there's always an enemy. The idea that there is always someone
that you should always be afraid of, that You should, you know, being a to in a relationship of a position towards you, so so far does it make sense
when you, when I think about, let me know people. Are you guys there, too, or or everybody know i'm so tired, you know i'm going. We're so you're too boring.
Makes sense.
Okay, makes sense. Good. Thank you. So look.
Is it the kind of I think about Canada? Do we get that in Canada.
Probably you're gonna tell me no more cell, you know. I mean, you know that's not how you know our society goes. What you're describing here when it comes. For example, individuality here is the opposite. Our society is exactly the opposite of Big Brother. Think about children
now. I don't know if you guys have children, or if you have siblings, or even think about yourselves, because you might be very young. So I mean
kids, they have options. What kind of outfit. What kind of clothing do you want to wear today? This, this, this or that? We have a lot of options? There is a huge encouragement for us to, you know, be ourselves for us to be unique, to feel unique, to do things that are unique, to be unique.
right so that what we don't have that in 1984. Okay, we don't have this external
force controlling us. Oh, we have the government in order. We have the government in Alberta. Yes, we have law enforcement. We have police. Yeah. But you know nobody's, you know, like
telling you. You know you're not doing whatever you're doing. You're having the wrong kind of breakfast. No, I mean, you know there is surveillance, but it's not that.
and the governance is not through conflict, you know. Of course we do have. Sometimes we do hear narratives about us and them. You know them can be immigrants. It can be foreigners, it can be, you know, you know we can be the other, you know, but we sometimes we get that, but it's not really how we how we most of us, how we function
right? So
so here, let me let me just go, you know.
and kind of here. I'm gonna go over some of the excerpts and the the they're reading that I gave you the reading that I gave you.
He has a bunch of excerpts right like from the book. So i'm gonna i'm gonna go over some of it. The most important stuff just like to highlight some of this stuff for you. Okay.
Okay. So people
the book talk like the some of the excerpts they talk about people going to rally like rally goers. I don't know. If you guys remember that, please. You know now, it's the time that you go.
Oh, let me just see Joan here. What's an example? An example of service being terminal.
we're going to see that in the next to book.
But i'll give you right now.
Let's suppose that I tell you, Joy Joy, do you hear me? Just say as in the chat, because I want to speak to you here, and everybody else but joy. Are you there?
Okay, Great. So let's suppose I tell you
I tell you, Joy, I am going to give you.
I'm gonna give you a 10 percentage. I'm gonna give you 10 percentage points, people. This is an example. I'm not giving any points yet.
I'm gonna give you 10% 10 percentage points for you to show up in class. But the condition is you cannot be late.
Tell me here in the chat, or feel free to come to the mic. How you're gonna behave! Behave If I tell you that you're gonna get, you know, 10 percentage points in your final grade. If you're not late in class.
if you are on like exactly on time, every time
you're gonna be yeah, and in in. How are you gonna actually make that happen?
That being on time, what you're gonna do is you're gonna be Probably violence is saying, i'll make sure. Yeah, Exactly. But how I wanna I want to ask you.
You know people here, Greer, is it Pop? Pop? Am I killing your name, Grey, or it's a great or it's okay. Career: okay, Greer. So Gre, your Valencia and everybody else here. How do you make it happen? How do you? Yeah, You put an alarm clock. You try to remember You're gonna You're gonna rely on a lot of
devices, and even you know self. You're going to rely on a lot of devices that will help you. Do self surveillance.
Do you agree with me?
So that's that's it. So i'm giving you here an example of you know of a need terminal kind of surveillance.
So they're i'm gonna i'm gonna burn my lectures. I mean, not. We're like how to say that. But this is, i'm gonna just like, you know, whatever i'm gonna give it. I'm gonna give it to you right now. I'm not gonna wait until the end.
I'm: gonna you know, like the other kinds of governance governance that we have, and that's gonna be the brave new World. It is a a kind of governance that
that is internalized. You don't need any big, but all are telling you. It's just like the way it works. The bureaucracy the way that things work is just like they give you an incentive for you to do self surveillance, and an incentive for you to be compliance in compliance doesn't make sense. Let me see here.
Yes, but at the end of the day it's external, either. It is you I agree with you. It is, I mean I would. Oh, why sort of agree?
Because
he.
How do I say your name?
Okay, yeah, the trigger think with me? She? Oh, yeah, she I remember. Yeah, she be so. Shivi, it is
the trigger. The trigger might be external.
but the actual surveillance happens internally.
so the trigger. It might be me, the Prof. Telling you all you know. I'm gonna give you this, or it might be a discount store, like, you know. It might be, you know. Let's say you know it might be sport checks telling you, you know. Bring this coupon, and you're gonna get this in that or chop this, you know. It might be a a trigger might be an external trigger. But like the actual surveillance, the monitoring that data collection happens internally.
Okay, Also.
it makes sense. TV. Okay, good people, you stop me because this needs to make sense for you. Okay. So let's go back in here here. Rally goers. So what i'm gonna what those excerpts, Marcella. What about those excerpts, the excerpts that I asked you to read.
They actually
the purpose here is to illustrate those 4 boxes.
Okay, it's just to illustrate. Do you guys get it? So you know I, what I gave you is like for me ideas. And now we're gonna illustrate how that happens.
Okay, in society.
So here, let's talk about the rally. So we like in that society
every day
they do rallies. So what that means, I mean, you know you go outside. You let's suppose we're all at the over working, and then you go outside, and then you're supposed to, you know, like you know, like, do rally against some sort of enemy.
So you don't really know what it's the enemy. It can be anything but it just to rally.
And you, you know you kind of you put it out there just like when you are in a soccer game in Brazil or hockey game. Here you you just like scream your lungs, and you call all names that you want to call, and you you, you kind of you. You direct all your all your emotions towards that enemy, and it's going to be bad emotions. You just put them all of them, you know it's all kind of a catars. It's in English, or even it's like it's just you trying to kind of, you know. Get all the
bad thing out of you, you know. So that's what the party promoted. The big brother promoted that so
you know. So you you it's also. It was a way for you to regulate emotions, because if you get your emotions and you keep them inside.
it can be dangerous for the party. So the party just okay. I'm going to create a space where you go and it's mandatory. And you kind of you. You put all your emotions in there. Okay, I'll get to the chat in a second. So you just do that. So that was like those rallies, and also around is they were like, you know. They happen like every day all the time, you know, here and there, and and there was also something more institutionalized, something that was promoted by the school, the workplace
that was like something called 2 min hate.
So it was like it was a session where you would hate something.
you know. So
you know. So that was it. So keep this in mind. I'm gonna i'm gonna come back to that. So
in this society we had a lot of
just check the chat. The survey is also happening. If they are only
yeah, it does, you know it does.
you know, because when we engage in in self surveillance, right? So
we're the only one. Yes, it does. Okay, because ultimately. And here, Valencia, let me challenge you and everybody else ultimately.
even if there is just one way there is just like we are the only person observing our ourselves.
We always do whatever we do, because something that's social, something that relates to back to society or to our family, or to our friends, or you know, to get what I mean Like it's it's very. I cannot think.
I cannot think of something that in my life that I do that doesn't really.
you know.
speak back to society. Oh, Marcella, when you are at the beach in Brazil, kind of just like being lazy in some hammock, I mean, that has nothing to lose society has.
I mean, because I mean it. It's. It's very Brazilian to to be lazy on a hammer.
It's something that we don't do in Canada. It's very President to start with, so that in itself speaks to Brazil society. So it's. We are social beings right. So whatever we do speaks back to society somehow. So
anyways, back here in that society.
it was all about alternative facts
and
destruction of evidence. So the big brother, the the State. They worked in a way that they added events, historical events, and that was actually the job of Smith
is Smith had that job, you know. Oh, let's support. Give you a practical example. Let's suppose that we, or saying you know we were enemies. You know you were an enemy of let's say the Us.
Okay. So we are an enemy of the Us. And then let's suppose that for whatever reason the party, the party, the big brother, they make an agreement with the Us. And now we're going to be friends with the Us because we're going to sell something to the Us. And the Us. Gonna buy something from us. So now we are friends.
And then what? W: okay, but okay, there is a there is a a conflict here. Yes, there is. But the way that it works is like the party Order someone to revise all the historical documents and add it everything
everywhere where it said that you know in the us. They were enemies. Now it's gonna say that they were friends. So you know it's so. There was an entire department called Ministry of True Truth or miniature that did that kind of job. Okay, so.
And and here I don't know if you guys can see on the screen. But like, there is this quote.
Who
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the past, the present controls the past so that that's exactly what they were doing in, and this sentence became this: a phrase, this, this, this
quotation. It became very famous. I mean, you know, indeed, because you know people who control the past, they control the future. But people but people for for you to control the past. You need to control the you need to control the present.
So anyways like, I don't know. Try to wrap your head around with this thing later, and try to rep. Wrap your head around that sentence, I mean. But that was kind of you know they like. That was the summary of how you know all the the creation of facts.
And did you know the the you know the the creation of facts, and also the destruction of evidence, like the whole logic behind the creation of facts and and and destruction of evidence worked around. You know, this logic of you know who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. Okay?
And and i'll another thing that a lot of the information
was added, you know, for for to make the the leader look like more kind of, you know, to look better in people's eye. So you you, you know the leader, would never be caught in some sort of contradiction, you know. So
there was also in that society the fear of others, so like the all there could be anyone. It could be a foreigner. It could be, you know, a war enemy. It could be someone who who did not like, who did not support the party, you know, you know. But there are. There was also the idea of ordering the idea of placing someone in that position of other that you would hate. That was part of the governance. So you you, as a citizen of that society, you would be always okay. Who should I hate
right like you should. Who is the target? I mean so.
And and also like that idea that you should like that that kind of idea you should always fear and and hate. The other was legitimized, was made legit, and also reinforced.
for example, through public executions. So there was a lot of enemies. They would be, you know, executed in public, and people would be encouraged to, and and then they would kind of scream, and that will become a rally like you screaming, and you know, like that's that to that person. Right? It was awful right.
Few good catch phrases. There, there's a lot of few good catch phrases throughout the book and throughout that society. But essentially what we can summarize all those few good catch phrases into, You know kind of happy life, kind of propaganda.
you know. So it's just like you know, propaganda, that you know we are great, we are, we are wonderful and and and like our, you know, like if if that was Alberta, you would be the equivalent of okay. We have more oil than ever. You know our oil stocks. They're super high, you know. The price of oil is going up. You know we are all happy. Every Alberta has a a a family doctor, You know every Al Alberta baby is like healthy. I mean, you know that kind of
happy life. Successful kind of, you know, governance kind of narrative. Okay.
they churches, was another.
It's very important facet or characteristic of that society. So like we have excerpts, you know that illustrate that.
And and and the idea was whenever you other
the other person like. Whenever you have an enemy, you know. That was in some, Somehow that enemy somehow reinforced the idea that you are good.
so you know you would. The the the idea of an enemy would always come together with the idea that our country is better like. Oh, there is this person, you know the enemy and and the enemy comes from this place where it's awful, and we are better. So. There's like, you know this the idea of patriotism right like.
but in patriotism, not in a not in a way, you know, kind of good way. Oh, I love my country. I like my my culture. No, it we. It was always in a way that would undermine another culture or another country, right so kind of
there's no literature on that, but I would call it a kind of toxic patriotism, you know that is, it's not about it's like you undermine the orders to be, you know.
international relations was all about was very conflictual.
Enemies versus a lies
science. There was no word for you for it. So, Neil speak the the language from that society they eliminate the word science. So there was like there was no word for science. That was the way of making science disappear. So there was no science right in that society.
So it was all about principles. It doesn't matter if whatever science, No, it's about principal. If you believe in that you do it. If you believe that that's true.
you just do that. If you believe that you know that you know that you know this, whatever mad scene is good for health. Take it.
if you believe that that's bad for health, just don't take it I mean, you know it's just like. But again, but the principles they were not individualized. It. It was not up to you to take a medicine or not take a medicine. It was up to the government, and and here
I should. I should make a connection here with, like all the movements against the vaccine.
for example, a lot of the people. I've seen people against vaccine movements, a Ca questioning vaccine, and and and criticizing the Government use of vaccine not only Canada, but also Brazil and also in Europe, and France
a lot of the people when they were being in rallies against the government and vaccine they they were saying, oh, this is not 1984.
So I've seen in Canada, France, and Brazil signs of people saying, you know this is not a a 1,984. So there what they were alluding to this idea that the Government
tells you what to do right. So they they that a lot of the people I did. I didn't have a chance to to interview or do research on it, but like but a lot of like, just from reading the signs like that people were holding, like everywhere all the all the countries that I've been to in this Covid time I could see that they were questioning, You know. I mean the State can't do that to us. Right so. And they were.
They were in fear of their country so it could be Canada, Brazil, or France that you know, becoming
okay. So so this is something for us to think here, you know, and and and even for that, what's what's interesting about this book is that it helps us to interpret those fears that they had where they they were coming from right like.
So in terms of private emotion, As I said no private abortion whatsoever, and except if there was law for the party that was allowed.
and and there was a lot of thought control. So you know, whenever you had bad emotions or emotions, that you're not supposed to have, you had to engage in crime. Stop, right.
Okay, people. Am I making sense to you so far.
Is it insightful? Are you kind of all this is interesting? It makes me think, or it's just like super boring. You gotta tell me. You gotta give me feedback, you know, because again the purpose is like I'm telling you when you're supposed to be. Oh, I here and make your connections in your, you know.
in your head.
So here I am, going to take you to China now.
So I told you that this book was published in 1,949. It is not for the same year that the Revolution was happening in China.
so I would like to share something with you
for those I don't know if I have any people from China, or anyone who has been to China has said in China anyone who is familiar to China. But probably if I have those feel free to engage, and you probably you're gonna know what i'm telling you.
One of the first things that the Communist party did in China in 1,949, was to simplify the language, As you guys know, Chinese mandarin is a very hard language to speak and write specially right, just because he's. I mean, if you you know you learn like to write is really hard.
So the party had very high the excuse of the period that the most of the purpose behind was that at the time of the Revolution about 95 of the population in China they were in Literate. They could not read and write, and the party had this thing about modernizing the country.
By the way, very, you know in the in the 1984 you get this narrative about modern I modernization as well. Okay, you have this. All we need to modernize. You. Get that throughout the book.
so China had to modernize, and they had to take those people who are literature out of literacy. And one thing that they did was to simplify the language just to give you an idea.
If you see my screen right now, this is like
the work China, Chinese.
and and can you see that in here is also the award China and Chinese, after you know, being simplified. Can you see that this this character here?
It's very complex to right. Imagine you have to do this little box with like main strokes inside, and then they simplified. Look at this. So this became that, okay
or this other character. That is, it means a language. Okay, this is the word for language in Chinese. It was like that. It became like this. It became more kind of simple to write. So what? And actually this simplification happened in 1,950 a year later
they start to prepare the movement in 1949, and then in 1,950. They just simplified the language in case you're curious Hong Kong
and Taiwan.
They and also my cow in China. They do use the complex version. So we have the simplified version for all over China, and we have the complex version.
They like Taiwan, my account, and in in Hong Kong they kept, you know, the complex version.
So it's it's an irony that I mean. Obviously, when Jard World he wrote the book. He did not know that the priority was going to simplify the language. You guys get what i'm saying, I mean this guy was really a vision there like he. He he was really good, you know.
Lucy, Thank you for your question. Worldwide. Yeah. Like usually people now.
because China mill and China is so big it's so huge, it's so important, and became a huge like economy and a huge society very significant in the world. If if you, you, Lucy, if you're going to learn Chinese in Canada, you're going to learn the simplified version, unless unless you seek lessons from someone who's from Taiwan or or Hong Kong or Mccall. But if you're going to like the the norm, the standard language in China now is the simplified version.
Okay, is it clear. Let me know if that's clear.
So yeah, so I know I have a lot of I I I speak Chinese, and I write Chinese, and I write, simplified. I have a lot of friends who, especially those who research Chinese philosophy and also Chinese
Buddhism. Like religions in China. They they use the old version the complex version, because all the you know, the stuff that the research that they do requires that. But for me I do the simplified. I can read most of the complex, but I I write simplified.
and in a lot of the Chinese people they can read complex characters, but they write simplified me. Okay, you know, I I hope, if it's not clear, let me know. Okay, yeah. So Shinta is is correct simplified version. So governance. When we think about China, for example.
the entire governance in China from 1,949 all the way to 1,978. Look not today, not today. Okay, from 49 to 78
was very much based on conflict.
Marcella I don't get what you're saying. Let's just skip one slide here
i'm going to skip.
We just keep up your fuselides here. I'm going to share you some something. Look, look at this.
This is a marriage call
that Mao Mao Zedong. He is. He was the leader in China. Okay, he was. Let me just type his name. Now.
you know. Sometimes you also see like that. Say.
you also see like this? Okay. So mounted on, he was the guy who did. He was the leader who did, who led the Communist revolution in China, and when he was very young he wrote 7 of large polls that actually became the basis of the governance in China after the Communist revolution.
One of the articles that I love, and it's very crucial. Very important is this one. It's called Analysis of the classes in Chinese society. Look at the movie Skip the red, skip the red, and look at the first line in the article. This is just an example. So you see that i'm not coming up with like crazy things. I mean, this is real.
Look at this. Look at the the first line. Who are our enemies who are our friends.
And then he goes on right. Like.
So
this article is extremely important, because that governance between 49 and 78 was all about. If you are not my enemy.
you know you turn on, my friend. You are my enemy is very binary, extremely binary. Keep that word in mind. It's a governess, a binary kind of governance, and and and what he did.
this, this article he wrote before the Communist Revolution. But what he did here he was asking.
He was suggesting that after the Revolution Society should be organized according to classes, but like labels, so each person would have a label. And again, this is the surveillance. When I label you. I'm a collecting data on you. You become a thing, and then, you know I can do starts on you. I can govern you right. So so he created labels, and actually that actually was implemented.
And and in in in that society 1984, we didn't really have labels. We just had 2 labels, enemies and friends. Mao also had enemies and friends, but he also had he divided, and it is in types of enemies and friends and some types of of friends, right? So
i'll get to you in a second here, and just go back and tell you more, and also in China.
in China, just like in 1,984. We had denunciation, rallies or struggle sessions that need to what that? Was
those?
Where is it? Those 2 min hate?
Think.
because i'm the same. So here in China, you know, like I could, I could tell you forever about those I even have. I had a I have a friend whose parents was, you know, like wasn't an in China, and because that that the you know, anyways like my friends
father and mother was a university professor and the university professors. During the revolution in China they were considered enemies, so they had to like. They had to parade around campus, and people throw eggs and rotten eggs and poop tea on them, you know, and they they would have like tags like I have an enemy of class. I am an enemy, you know I am this, and that, you know they would like. You know they They would have like
flakes change to them like on their you know their necks. And so those were, you know. So they. So that was an example of an initiation, rally
or struggle, session, struggle. Session was Well, there was a little bit of a difference. The rally was, you would actually parade the enemies, and you'd, you know, curse them and throw things on them. But the the struggle session was like like, you know.
Let's suppose you would get me. I am the pro. You would get me in a room, and you guys would come in there, and you tell all the things that you think about me, and you'd criticize me and you'd insult me. You know that would be the kind of thing you know. That would be a struggle session, or you know sometimes you would. You would be forced to do that on yourself. You would come in, and you know, and expose yourself all you know. So that was very similar to what we saw in 1984, you know.
and individuality. China also was banned between 1949 and 78 again, you know, like you know, people were very
careful about their lives.
I mean my Chinese friends. They tell me that you know at that time they would. They would keep their feelings just inside of the family. They wouldn't share their opinions about anything, if anybody didn't know, and even inside of the family, sometimes they were afraid of sharing their opinions and feelings, and you know so any kind of individuality, you know, was banned. Everything was towards, you know, the the government, the State society, you know, the the the collective goals.
Anything that was an individual goal was banned. Okay.
So
i'm just getting to chat here.
Yeah, Valencia, you have a very good question, because the problem is.
I don't think
that the book influenced. I don't think I don't think that 1984 influenced like China, for example, I think that I don't think so.
I what I think that happened here is that, like George or he was very. He was a very good researcher, and he could sense
because I mean he could like, you know he could. He was observing watching society, and he could sense where he, You know Russia. The Russian revolution was much earlier, so he could see where things were going to, you know. And and then he wrote this kind of you know. He transformed
his observation observations of society to this Dystopian novel, you know. So that's what I really think. I don't think that you know this book had the power to influence anything you know like to actually make people, you know, duplicate or see on, You know I don't think so.
So at the same time, we we're gonna all your questions really good. But I say, we're gonna get there
elsewhere in the world. We didn't have none of that. But we did have the TV influencing people. We're gonna talk about that because that comes in the in danger view with Huxley. But hold their horses. We're gonna. This is very good what? You're what you're coming up with, you know.
Oh, let's see if there's anybody. If I miss anything, I don't think so. Let's keep.
So here is just to give you an idea. Okay.
So what this little drawing that you see here those 2. It's just like drawing of a china after the Revolution.
and the Government trying to show how wonderful China was. This was a commune in the countryside. Everybody working. Can you guys see everybody happy, you know, call like harvesting their crops. You know a lot of food.
you know, like, you know. So 90% of the people they this is just me for me to tell you guys at at that time in China, 1949 all the way to 78, 9, 90 of the population. They were rural, so they had a rural life. And then 10% of the population they were. They had a urban life, you know.
Marcella, how did how did you distinguish them, urban from rural, because people could move? No, in China people could not move. And why do you guys remember that household
registration system that I talked about less? I use as an example as class, because people had their classification, so they could not move. Okay, China, Just so, you know. But anyways, this is like posters. This is government propaganda. Those 2 are government propaganda
just to kind of exemplify how beautiful life was the reality people. The reality was completely different here in China, just to give you an example in 1961 1962. In China, 35 million people starved.
So life in rural China was nothing like that people were miserable just like they were in okay, They were starving. They were miserable, you know, but the Government had this happy life kind of propaganda, you know, like.
And this is my picture. This is not a this is me. Okay, this is just me showing how now you know, China is now different. The message here is, remember China, the China that I'm describing here, and I'm comparing for Sanya is not the china that we have today.
Okay, China changed a lot from 1,978 to today, you know. An example is like you don't see that separation. You see the buildings you see the crops. You see the corn, you know it's different. Okay.
Just see here
that you had.
So
yeah, exactly that to your yeah death March and starvation, etc. Exactly. That.
That's the reality. Okay.
So I we talked about this, and here the next is. This is like what it's written in here Chinese. It's here for you.
Excuse me a special agent.
Where are you running to?
So this is a government propaganda. This is like the god like After the Revolution, the Chinese people.
They were like a
chasing down the enemies. And here, if you observe this picture, you can see that the enemy was an American. Can you see here us
see where my curs are well done. If
if you see on the picture, I don't know if i'm putting the curs on the right place, let me, just
if you see on the picture here. There is a us thing here for you, you know, like
So
so this is just an example of the the the of this like enemy that we get in, I mean, I'm just using the Chinese example. So just so. You want to materialize it in front of you. You know
this is an honor pollster. Those are all pollsters. Okay, Government propaganda. If you put China poster.net, you're gonna find all of them there. There.
here. This is another example.
regulation of of the People's Republic
on punishing counter revolutionary. So all the people who were considered counter revolutionary. They were against the Communist revolution. They were on an enemy. And then, you see, like the the of the flashlight, is like you're giving visibility to them. It goes back to what I said is a very visible kind of governance.
like you pinpoint people. You tell you what I mean. I'm going to catch you, you know.
So this is another example.
This is like late marrying late has many advantages. One of the first things that the Government did well the Communist Government did in China was to raise
the the age, the marriage age from 18 for women, and 20 for men to 20 and 22.
So we went from 1820, 2022. Why? Because, like the population, was always like part of the governance narrative, like, we need to control the population we have too big of a population. So everything like the population was an excuse for everything.
So if they need they, they actually they didn't have the money to feed everybody that was a reality. But then, like you know, all that all the sudden it was like, you know, you know, like early early marriage is not good late. Marriage is good, because
that's good for the country. They just don't take exactly what that is. So it's kind of that. The same idea in in all you don't really know what's going on. But you just know that, you know. And if you ask why, first of all, it's, it's it's wrong to ask Why, it's it's wrong. You never can challenge the party by asking why. But if you know, if you ask why, people say, because we need to modernize.
it goes back to the idea of double. Think you don't. Really, you know, I think that they don't really make sense together. Okay, if we're going to modernize.
you know. But what? What? How about like late marriage? What does it have to do with modernize me, you know, like things are not obvious. You know Everything's kind of, you know, hidden, and and you can't really challenge anything
but regardless the discourse about population, population, and modernization, population and happiness. You know that that was a big theme in China, and also in If you read the book.
And then it it became like propaganda about Birth Control.
you know Birth control. It was, you know, again, as I told you, you know you could only have sex if there was, for procreation
in China was a little bit different. I mean you. You could have sex, but but it still, like sex was the whole thing was procreation, because.
you know, birth control, you know, wasn't quite there, and then it became something. And then the Government start to use birth control, you know, and and tell people who don't have kids, and then they implement their one child policy. But the point
the point is that those regimes there is a a big attempt and a a very huge attempt to to regulate people's sexuality.
So you know, Cnn. And in China is all is all about, you know. Let's regulate people sexuality, so it can be. Either you have sex for creation, or you have sex or whatever; but, like the government, is always kind of intruding in your in the bedroom, like you know, in your sex life. Let's put that way.
Another example here. This is an example. When the Government launch it.
people the people's community. China. Okay, the people's community. Was this: this, like the idea that you know, is is the basis of common, is that we all produce together, and we share, You know, the the results of the production, you know equally
so, which can be very unfair to some people. They do work harder than others, but but again, in common is that everybody's the same. Everybody's equal, and you know it. We share so. But the main point here is this narrative of a very happy life. It's almost like, you know. Now we're gonna have food. Look at this basket.
It's it has grains. He has food. He has like neat vegetables, you know. And then you. This is like being carried by the dragon. Dragon here means China, because China in China, like the symbol of Chinese dragon, so like, you know. So anyways, I mean the whole purpose just to show kind of give you some concrete elements
of the book.
You know it's all to kind of teach you, or kind of we make you think about those 4. You know those 4 points that we are discussing. Okay.
So what you are learning. Now, if I am doing a good job is that I mean, you're going to be able to identify.
You know types of surveillance that they are more visible, more forceful. You know that there's no space for individuality, and that you know it's it's done through conflict. Okay, so so that's my goal here. I believe, from achieving my goal. But that's the point.
So far any questions Did I make sense to you?
People? Are you guys awake?
Yes.
okay. Is it interesting to to kind of, you know.
the examples are really interesting. Now.
Yeah. So okay, so good. So I know that i'm kind of taking too much time. But it's okay, because I I know that next fast, you know, I we can manage. But anyways, let's I. I still have a couple of minutes here 10 min, right like I have 10 min. So let's start here Fragments from brave New World. By Avos Huxley.
Now, I would like you to forget about what we just learned.
Okay. So now we're gonna to something else.
We're gonna see something that's actually much more closer to what we have here.
And i'm gonna give it to you. I, personally.
I don't know what kind of surveillance is worse.
Worst works. Sometimes I think I used to think before I I have. I had classes with Hagerty, and I read all the literature that you guys are reading, and I took my time, and I went back to China to do to this, to to to, to to collect data on surveillance.
I don't know today. I sort of think that I You know that life under the big broader might be even easier. I don't know. Sometimes some days I wake up, and I think, okay. Life under 1,984 is gonna be easier than life in the brief new World. I don't know. Sometimes today as of today. I think that the brave new world is harder.
you know, and you guys are gonna go like. What is that even possible? No, I don't know I I can. This is this is, I mean, the point is here is not which one is works, but it's more kind of see. You can see different types of surveillance.
So look, this book was published in 1,900 and
32,
and I and that that's what makes me find this book amazing, because you know it it talks about today's society in Canada, for example, it would be applied to Canada, and it was written much before you know
what we having I mean. You know this guy for me, the Prof. He was a truly visionary. I mean, this guy is like he rocks my world.
I highly recommend this book people.
So the place is the same as London. Okay. The chapter that I gave you to read is it for is chapter number one. So just kind of invite you. I gave this chapter on purpose, because maybe you're going to like in order to read the whole book. So. But it is about. It is a tour. Someone's taking a tour at the hot, at at a hatchery
and conditioning center.
Okay, so it's like in the place where this in this society, in brave new World, the babies they are not made by humans. They are mating labs. Okay, so it's much more advanced. I mean the control of this state, and it's not really one state. I mean, there's not one big brother. There are many big brothers.
Okay? And that's what I like about that, too. It can be the state. It can be the the big company can be Google. It can be, you know, Amazon it can be, you know. I Food it can be, you know.
Do we have. If we don't, we don't have my food here. I Food is in Brazil. Here is skip the dishes. It could be uber. It could be, you know it could be the State. It could be the government, it could be, it could be the school. It could be anywhere. It's for me. It's more kind of, you know, complex to it's a more complex kind of idea.
But anyways, in the regime
the regime there was an authoritarian regime. Okay.
and it was. You know, English Socialism here. It's more like, you know, a democracy.
You know the way that the book is kind of set and kind of democracy where people have choice where they can side about, they can make choices about their lives, you know. So it's much more a democratic society language. They Don't really have a dictionary. They do have special words. Okay.
But what's interesting here is that you? Months are classified.
There is a language for you to name humans. So we have Alpha Beta, Gamma Delt and Epsilon people.
So whereas before we had just enemies, and in France and and here it's much more complex. It's almost like
There's we need to society. We need absolute. Who, you know, do the work that you know that some some people don't want to do so. It's almost like the society that we have here today a society where there's no space for everybody, not everybody can succeed, because there's just so many positions in the Government for each work, or, if you want to, you know, be a professor. There are just so many propositions, professorships for you. So there's there there many more people who want to be so there! There's not space for everybody. There's no room for everybody.
and society is organized in a way where certain people are going to make a lot of money, and they're going to have a lot of prestige and certain people. They're going to do very little money, and they're going to work that are not prestigious. Right? So so we have those kinds. So in that hatchery we have those kinds of people being created right. So
I know i'm down to 5 min. So Mr. Foster is the director of the center, so he is giving a tour.
And then here we in this book we also have a deviant character. His name is Bernard Marx. Okay, this guy's deviant because he's an Alpha, but he's too short for an Alpha.
Okay, so. And he always feels bad about himself because he doesn't quite feed the profile. Okay, so this and there is a profile. So here, let's just do this slide, and then we've finished the rest next class, and then we all we're going to do full call and delays to next class, and i'll try to be faster. But look at this.
The type of surveillance here is invisible. There is no sinister person, you know.
trying to kind of nail you or catch you or watching. You know
they're just in personal forces. They're a bunch of in personal sources. So it is the Prof. Giving you extra points to show up in class. It is the Gpa. Scale for you to study, so you can go to medical school. It is like, you know it is like, you know, we
your school kind of like, you know the the the 8 people class and be people class, you know, like you know the sorting. There's a lot of sorting society.
but there's no like it's everything is invisible. You don't really even think about so when I gave you think about your prof giving you an extra kind of credit for you to be on time? You guys never thought about that as self surveillance, right? So you you can. Oh, my gosh! You know this is surveillance. It's it's the worst kinds they want to be. I don't know if that's the worst kind, but I mean it is the kind that it is inside of you
right that you bring it inside is almost like the big, broader inhabitants You right. So
monitoring
very internalized self censorship, Individuality there is like
It's super welcomed. It's all about. You gotta be yourself.
You have so many choice. The options to choose from.
You know you have so many, you know you have like. Look at the span.
I have like 4 callers, this Wonderful! I have options, but again
it's it's almost like options within a pattern options within a range. You go to save on foods, and then there is like this whole like, you know, hallway, pack of cereal overse. I love cereal. Okay. You go by cereal like you have, like a a lot of cereals that you know at I say, on phones.
But if you actually read the ingredients, they're all the same. It's just some sort of flower with some sort of call calling, and it's just a shape that changes
right, and then the level of sugary. That's it, I mean. But it's the same. It's pretty much the same if you do that kind of survey, and you're gonna see it. So so there is a lot of like there's a thing you know. Buy me, buy, you know, like someone tells buy from me by from me. But essentially you're buying the same thing. So here is like, you know, a lot of callers, but still the same pen, you know.
and data like individuality, take note of that. Individuality becomes data.
It becomes data.
your behavior, your individuality, your likes and your dislikes. It becomes it becomes a threat of data that's going to feed some sort of system, right? So. And governance happens through compliance. So I don't need to, you know, to be harsh on you. I don't need to make your rally a rally.
I you know I don't need to make you, you know. No, I. You are willing to apply, because you know you want to be an an alpha you, you know, like you want to. You know you want to be a better If you are excellent. You want to be bad, or alpha, I mean, you know there's a sense that you know that you You want to change your life. You want to to grade your life so you comply
right? So so. Look at the same thing that I did with your other article like I went over the like some of the excerpts You're gonna see later here when you actually read. If you haven't read yet you're gonna see that my, my, my butter points. They coincide with the actual text, you know.
And here i'm going to do the same thing for you. I'm going to highlight. Some of this stuff.
you know.
and I am going to then talk a little bit about the interview with all those Huxley. Okay? And then we're going to do the the rest. So I'm going to stop here for today.
and I do have all sour today in case you need me, i'm gonna be here.
It's, it is another link. It's not on the same link, and and I think that's it for today.
Let's see if you have in case you have.
I've been a sore throat since Brazil, you know. But anyways, if you have any question, please stay on the line here so I can address you. We have 10 min before my my actual offs hours. I can. I can use that 10 min with you. So that's all, for today. Is it making sense people. If it's not just stay on the line. I want to make sure that you guys get it that everything is in order. Okay, so Thank you so much. You guys take care of yourselves and do that. What I ask You keep
watch, surveillance, start to kind of classify surveillance. All this surveillance is more like 1984, this one's like more like a brave New world. Okay. So start to kind. Of think about surveillance and classify surveillance. Now, okay.
Thank you very much. I'm: I'm gonna look from now on. It's gonna be live lecture. So you know it's unless I have something urgent. But otherwise we live. So I I see you again on Thursday. Live and thank you very, very, very much for being here. And you guys take care.
Thank you. Everybody. People.
Yes, always recorded. Always my lectures there, all regardless. They're going to be always reported always. Okay.
Okay, good.
I'm going to stop a recording just in case
let me trust me anything.

<h1>Jan 19</h1>
  <p>
"Hello, everybody, Welcome back. Do you guys see me? Do you hear me?
Hello, folks? Okay. Chats here? Okay. Great. Okay. So how is everybody. Today
I came all pumped and excited about to this class. Are you guys doing well?
Okay. So look
not too bad. Okay, not too bad. Not too bad it's not very good.
Okay, look, look, folks. Let me just share. I'm sharing my slides. I'm just to get them up. So okay, here we go again and just duplicate this line.
Okay, so let's see if you see me. I see the chat right here. Okay, we're good to go. So look
last time we met we talked about like, not like novels. We talked about the big brother 1984. I told you a lot. About it. I gave examples of it, you know, and
we stopped. I was talking about brave New World.
which is another novel. It's by the professor of the guy who wrote big brother I mean. His name is Ados Huxley. So we're talking about him, and I was stabbing. I gave you some like very context. I mean this this chapter Number one that I gave you. It is a hatchery in London.
and and it's pretty much like it's. It's a procreation center, but it doesn't really involve humans, because everything is is done through. It's like you know it. It's it's done through like, you know, in in the lab.
right? So it doesn't really involve humans. Of course you do have sperm that do have embryos and everything. But it's, you know you don't really have human contacting there. So essentially we're talking about like life being reproduced in a very artificial manner.
Right? So that is the context. This society just like 1984. He had a slogan, but it's kind of the opposite. This looking for 1984 was about war, and here's about stability community identity. So it's completely different. I told you that the setup here it's much more democratic. It's much more like what we have
in which they society, especially like here in Canada us, and you know, in the western side of the world. Let me just see. Okay, we're good. So if you have any messages, just put in the chat, because I have the chat writing for in front of me, and I told you that in this society
we don't really have book a new kind of a new speak a kind of a new vocabulary. But we do. You know, we do have distinctions for people. So we have like, because humans they are made in labs and and so like, that's in that society they are able to. Okay, we we need X Alpha, which is going to be the people who are very smart they're going to do, you know, high tech work, and then we need people who are absolute because they are not smart. They but they are like from the body perspective very strong. So like this novel
it praise, or it relies on all these stereotypes that we have in society. You know those stereotypes that we have all you know. This is manual work, this intellectual work. This is like your hands. If your hands are very fine, that means that you don't really do manual work all those which in those are stereotypes. They're not really true, right like, but you know, in that novel they they like the the author uses that stereotypes, because sometimes, even though those stereotypes they're not true. They are like generalizations.
We we use that to discriminate people. I mean i'm not saying you me, but like in society, you know we use that to discriminate people. So that's why kind of the offer you so you can. It can kind of show hierarchy in society. Okay.
So essentially the chapter that I ask you to read is like a tour, As I told you before, it's a tour, that hatchery which is in London right so. And I told you that this, like the power like governance surveillance in that society called Brave New world.
Yes, it's invisible.
You don't really see there is no like one sinister person trying to control everybody just like the big brother. There's not not such a thing. It happens very in a very silent way through organization, through procedures, through, You know, interpersonal
forces, it's like governess and surveillance happens through technology. So you don't really realize that you are being controlled
right so. And even like when you look at I mean, I don't know if you guys have the chance to read. But you when you read that chapter it feels like, oh, there's nothing wrong. It's a nice environment, air conditioning everything's clean, so it's just this guy, you know, like showing someone else. You know how babies are made, and different kinds of babe, and how they make like excellence, and all fuzz and bathtubs. Right? So it's Everything's very clean. Everything looks very scientific. The opposite of 1,984,
where even the word science doesn't really exist right like the and the monitoring. A lot of the monitoring is just self censorship. People know that they have to do, they know, and the the the lab procedures. For example, they know that, you know, if this baby is going to be an Alpha baby, you know you, the temperature got to be this or the procedure going to be that so we do, since I mean not we them. They're the novel they do censorship self censorship right? So they control themselves so they can control the environment.
Right? So
individuality, it's very it. It's actually welcomed.
So you know, people are. You know they're they're actually made clones that like this this they are actually what they're describing. There people is what we call clone, like, you know, like you remember the dolly like those little calls that like in the in the nineties, that they were the first animals to be cloned. So that's what it is. It's a cloning process. So so, but they do encourage individuality. However, just like I was telling you it is individuality within a parameter.
So it's like, okay, we're selling you like cereal, just like my example. Last week you're gonna go down, you know, save on foods. And you're gonna go shocking for for cereal. You're gonna find like I don't know hundreds of boxes, and it it looks like it feels like I have a lot of choices, right? So. Which one do you want? Do you want that that one, but when you actually
look at it grow closely you'll see that it's pretty much the same. It's flower some syrup, you know. Some. You know, some coloring and and and different shapes, and and different types of sugar. That's it. So it's the same. It's actually the same stuff.
but you know, but like it, there is this kind of little difference within the parameters that our time just all this one's better than the other one, and I like this one, and my brother, my sister likes that other one right? So
so it's about choice. So I tell you. You know you can do like professors at the of a. They tell you, you know you can do. Take home, exam. You can do, an you can do a multiple choice exam, or you can. Do, you know, some artwork or whatever, but you've got to do an exam, so there is no way out right like, you know, for those choices
with them to feel in that society brave new world, then we are very free. But actually the choices, you know. We, I, I ask myself, are we are we really free? And I would say, perhaps we are not free. What we have is autonomy.
autonomy, people is one thing. Autonomy means, okay. I can choose between whichever serial. But that's autonomy. But freedom is it really freedom? Because I mean, you know it's it's within the parameter. So this is something for you to think about. Okay.
and the governance happens through compliance. As I said last time I, there is nobody you know, like poking you. You got to for yourself. I got steady. I got to do well, because you know I need my Gpa, so I can go to law school. I can go to whatever school I can do. My second clinical psychology I can, you know, do whatever so you know it. You don't need anybody, I mean sometimes your parents might remind you of that. Some pros might remind you of that. But you know you know the way the game goes right. It's like.
you know. It's almost like. If you want to do that, you have to comply. And and pretty much in society people for everything that we gotta do. We gotta comply. I dare you to tell me here in the chat something that you know you do without any sort of compliance. It's really hard to think of something that you know that we can be truly, truly, truly free.
By the way, share with me if you have something in there, you know that I mean where you can truly be free, you know, like there's no kind of you know, self, surveillance, or censorship, or you know that, like they need to comply, you know.
So here, like, let's just go over. I'm gonna break a little bit. So what I mean, I kind of already said, but I want to emphasize this. So look.
I just close this thing here.
Okay, clean, clean cleanliness. So it's all clean it's all clean. It's scientific. It's bureaucratic everything's organized within the bureaucracy. Paperwork procedures
everything very organized, and and in that case of this book it's very. It's based on the agenda eugenics. So you have Gen. X. For those of you who Don't know is when you start to do social sorting, You're sorting humans according to physical and genetic care. I mean physical characteristics that they go back to genetics. So you are. You're kind of manipulating people's genetics so they can. You know you can change people so in. And and this this movement.
Eugeneics that was a very common movement in 1930. Even here in Alberta we did have the otherwise. You guys know that, by the way here in Alberta we had in 1920. We had the Sterilization Act. Have you heard of that? People?
Are you guys there.
or I am talking to my walls. Okay.
you heard right? So the way it worked it that look in that something. Let me let me let me clarify this. It actually it target everyone in society, not on indigenous people, Just so, you know.
but in the end indigenous people. They were the people who were the most like caught by the act, but like it, it it was for everybody. The rule was. And I know this because I actually read a lot about this thing. But the rule was that if you had any kind of mental health.
illness, or disorder, let's say depression. Ptsd. A. D. G. All those things that a. D. A. D.
Attention, a. Dg: right like it did it? A: Well, I think that's it.
Adhd that's it. So if you have anything, yeah, add okay, so any any of those things. Okay, that's correct. Thank you. Thank you, Lucy, and everybody else. So look, if you had any of those things that at that time they were. They weren't even like classified. They were not categorized at that time people in 1920, or 10, you were like. Oh, no, I kind of i'm feeling blue. You know anything
that. And then people take you to a hospital to see a doctor. The doctor had the power to classify you as as a mental health patient.
and that allowed a panel, a PIN of 5 people, 5 people
to decide if you should be sterilized or not.
and that will. In the in the beginning the very beginning was about mental health, but very quickly. They came out also about sexuality.
For example, people women who were too mainly like short hair, you know, for example, or they were deemed again, people deemed too manly, right, like they were challenging the standards or men who were like
according to the standards I mean true, feminine. If you were deviant somehow, if you're like, if you deviate from the norm, whatever was the you know, the standard. At that time you could be classified as a mental health patient.
and that qualified for the panel to decide on your life. So in the end, you know, in most people I mean most people, especially if they, If they were white and rich, they would get away with it, you know. So there was. There was no way that let's say.
Okay, how? Okay, Jessica, I'll come back to you in a second in a second. So, but at that time there was no way that if your your dad or your mother, they were rich farmers.
if they will, they would never allow anybody to touch you, and and to, you know, to sterilize you. And and but that was a reality for English Scottish people who came to a burden made money, but for everybody else was poor, and and also, you know, indigenous people. The reality was there, was they. It was very hard for them to get off the hook.
and they would actually be sterilized, you know. So in the end about 4,000 people got sterilized in Alberta, and and when you go back. And that excuse was this person who has a mental illness is diseased. Okay, disease with quotation marks and this person
it's genetically the they, their genes are bad. This person has bad genes, so we cannot allow this person to pass those jeans, you know, downward, you know, to to their, you know, like children and grandchildren. So so that's why they would sterilize right. But that. But when you actually look the files
of those 4,000 people who got sterilized. You see that their parents didn't have any problem.
So that means, I mean, if this, hey hereditary, I mean, that would come, you know. But it doesn't, I mean, you know. So, anyways, like he he held no scientific evidence. But people are being sterilized, and I have a lot of material that if you're interested. If you ever decide to do your your let's say your capstone, whatever you know your owners, whatever in this topic
you could, you could go to the Alberta Museum, the one that's been downtown, you know, you know. Anyways, I I can give you you contact me, I can tell you which one exactly, but it's the Provincial museum, and they having their all the files from those 4,000 people. And you actually can examine them, you know. And actually I think that some of those files were thrown away, I think actually now they only have 900 something, you know. But anyways they do have files. Okay, just about
ourselves. You find the norm. I love this question because the norm is volatile, keeps changing. So, for example, the norm, like 1,000. 911,920Jessica was that a man had to dress in a specific way. A woman had to have those like long gowns, and you know, and like hair, long hair, a woman would have to marry very quickly, like at the age of 1819, you know, as soon as she would get her first menstruation should get Mayor. I mean there was an arm. So today we don't have that Norman
any more social norms. They keep changing. So you know, when I say, according to the norm, is the norm of that time, I mean, you know again, you know today, if you have short hair like myself. Nobody is going to challenge your gender or your sexuality, because, or even make any connection to mental health because of your hair right? So I mean that change it and change very quickly, like in in less than a century. But you get the points of social norm, is whatever is established at that time, or, you know, in time, I mean in very
over time. Okay.
One was the act that that to other only No, No, no, they were the Jenna. The act was from people who were deemed mentally you.
However, this classification, mentally ill, was too broad, and anyone could be thrown in there again, a woman who did not actually their their files in there, of women
who did not want to get married, for whatever reason, you know, but there was like scandals. How dare you? You know that means that you have a disease. You have a mental disease, I mean. When I say those words loaded, I mean, I i'm reproducing that time. So put some quotations in there. Okay.
it was just a cover. Yeah. But you know, Raj: like the problem there was that the people who were behind this thing they they, they! They! They were full of good intentions. They truly they truly believed in that stuff they truly believed in that stuff.
You know they weren't like they. It is, it's just a i'm not excusing. I mean.
if someone was alive today they would get themselves in trouble. Just probably some people even got, I don't know, but like. But the problem is that was the mindset at the time not excusing. It was awful like I'd spies that right, but that's what they would do, and they had good intentions, and eventually eventually 1940 S.
People started to this. Is not this Doesn't doesn't? Make any sense, and then people start to challenge that, you know. And but that act was was
hosting English. It was like valid until until 1972, or 76. Anyways, I I have a lot of material that why I bring that up because in brand. New world is exactly what we had here in Alberta, you know, back in the days.
So you know this kind of your Gen. X. You know we can't let you pass your bad genes, and we have to kind of, you know, create humans who are perfect, and not only perfect, but perfect for different types of work in society. So we're gonna have the intellectual. We're gonna have. You know, the manual worker. We're gonna have different like types of manual workers, you know, all the way from someone who does like the very work that nobody wants to do all the way to someone who does the work that everybody wants to do, because well paid, or it's well regarded.
Right. So so that was the point in brave new World, the main, the main like incentive for voluntary compliance was a reward exactly the example that I gave you the other day, you know, to do something for me. I'm gonna give you a point.
you know. So not from now on. People be very, very careful with like what we call in English carrots. I'm talking about the vegetables because I have an accent, so I don't know if you get it like. You know the rabbit carrots. Be very careful with that, because sometimes people tell you things.
and they take you kind of you. Go. I'll give an example here personal example.
I I did a job. I I want to scroll as much because I mean, you know. Anyways.
I did a job interview to be to be a a full time faculty member like to be a profit. Some very big university here in Canada like a couple weeks ago, and and when I did this job interview they showed me the salaries.
and I was like, come on. You know this is too little. I have a lot of experience. I have a lot of money research like research money. So this is like. And then I was telling the person I mean, this is like, you know I mean I was. Of course I wasn't saying like this. I was very polite, very. You know all we know. Yeah. Well, this is a little bit disappointing. I will say, you know, like. But then I was chatting with this. The you know the person like the someone from the hiring committee.
and this person was like No, no, you don't have to worry, because if you come to work with us. One of the nice things that we do is like, you know. We give you a $50,000 for you to purchase, you know, to do the down payment on a home.
So people in general I mean I I i'm older people I I have, I, you know I
people who are kind of more like more immature than I am.
They would just fall for it. It was like, oh, this is amazing. You're gonna give me $50,000 for down payment. And indeed it is really nice. But when you look at the prices of that region in Canada
is just like astronomical. The real estate price that $50,000 is. It's not gonna be enough even to it's not gonna be even like, you know. You know, a quarter of of the down payment, you know, if you guys get what i'm saying so like people sometimes, and i'm give you here, you know, like when you do job interviews, or when you do anything.
be careful because people they throw like rewards that you and so isn't that nice, and then they put you in that kind of frenzy. Oh, it's nice! And then you kind of go with the flow, and then you go like, oh.
like shoot! What do they do? That's not worth it. You guys get what i'm saying. So be careful because society, brave New World and our society is all about that, you know. Like.
Yeah, Exactly. Exactly. Oh, yeah. So you you okay, I'm: yeah, it did so. The like, the Greer. Yes. So the the the act obviously in the end. All those 4,000 people who got sterilized, I would say that 90% of them they were indigenous people.
Okay, so it became a and another thing it became. It became a strategy, you know, to to eliminate indigenous people from society.
So it's it's just awful when you read that there is one professor at the University of Alberta
and also Valencia. You're right. Females. Well, I could just give a whole lecture on this thing. But, like Valencia, right females, they were more affected to the males. However, females Look, look! There's something interesting in here females.
because to procreate is something it's almost like divine. And at that time
it was almost. It was like something that you know it was religious. It was a religious topic, even to the to this day it is but at that time to pro procreation was very kind of, you know, a religion, you know thing I mean it's about religion you have to procreate. I mean, that's that's your mandate as a woman, right? So so that means what that? The panels they were more willing to reveal and revise decisions on women.
however, for men, they would never revise their decisions. So so like women got like, you know, on one side they were, you know they were like much more affected.
This is true, and on the other side for men, whenever they were, there was a decision on them. It's almost like there was no space for appealing.
Okay, so that was harsh, too. So it's like you, you know. So. But numerically yes, women, they were much more effective in indigenous women. Oh, my gosh, even more. So. Okay, you guys are pumping the chat Here, let's see.
I I agree. Yeah, exactly. You know you, we you we exactly like that's like what Can't said. And that's why I gave you that chance before, because I wanted to establish that. You know that that where, like our historical tradition, where we're coming from.
So, anyways be be aware of the carrier, you know the incentive. Be careful when people comes with a lot of carrots, you know. Raise your eyebrows and go like, okay, let me analyze this carefully, because
you might be you. That might be a tract. Be very careful. Okay. So like the like. All the the environments in in brave New World they are extremely controlled, you know, and and then, like they even talk in this chapter about something like a process called Boka Novicely book a novice key.
I mean. However, you on the call, I mean, this is a funny name, I mean. It's not like, you know, not funny, but it's on English, and but they they're actually talking about Cologne cloning, and that speaks to social stability. So essentially all that that control was geared
awards, trying to create this happy, you know, stable society, and that's pretty much what we crave. People Look, we crave that.
It's almost like we became child's children from the brave New World. We crave that stability, I guess. But, Marcella, are you? Do you want to war? Of course I don't want to war again. We are thinking Here we are, kind of, you know, making analysis. I don't. Why, I of course I prefer to do it. But like even though but it's almost like you know we
you know it's. You know we are in this boat like you know, the brave new world a kind of boat, you know.
so hierarchy, you know, like everyone is needed.
but it's almost like there is no space for everyone, so everyone is needed. There is a space. There is a space for everyone, actually, but not everyone can enjoy that very good space like that job with like status, you know, etc., etc. No, you know that's only for all phone. And then back to is going to be something that's lower. So I mean that there is this whole huge social sorting.
And this is really interesting. This is actually a line in the book that individuals are red destined so like it's almost like you. There is a mission for you, and you are also conditioned to that specific type of life.
So it's like there's no way out, really, and when I teach social problems.
my students, they come to me ourselves. Society is really depressing. It is. It is really depressing, because when I teach social problems. People.
I'm going to talk about income and income inequality. Do you guys hear me? Are you guys there?
Okay, I always get the same name. So I think it's just a few people who are paying attention here. So, anyways, okay, good. I see some other names now. Great. Thank you. People. So look when I, when i'm teaching a sociology tool, 3 at the U. Of a
or elsewhere, and I tell my people in classic people how much one do you expect to make.
and they come, and they tell me oh, I'm gonna make like after once you finish your degree. So people go. 60,070, 8,100, 110, a 199, 5, I mean, that's and then I make an average. I make an average, you know. People are kind of screaming, shouting their numbers, and I make an average, and then very quickly tell them. Look, the average is like let's, say you know, 9, 90 $98,000, and then I tell them people the average in Canada is 36. If you are a woman a man.
and in 32, if you are a woman, so it's like, you know. So it's I mean get Rio. I tell people right like you know it's almost like I. You know I I come with this like reality, like shocking reality, and people go. Oh, my gosh! It's almost like there is no way out, or you know, because we all have high hopes. We all we are doing this because we want to make money. We have a life. We want to be able to have a job going to be to raise family, or, you know, to do something right, all of us. We all have dreams. And then, when you, when we
look at society we see that I mean the the reality is really hard. One of the things that I hate doing is like going to the West Side with the Mall, because I see a lot of my former students working service there.
and it's for me. It's just like
It's just like you know. It's it's, it's, it's not about them, but we take it to the heart. We believe that it is about us. It's not about society. We feel I am a failure. Oh, I could not make it. Oh, I did not get in, or I. You know people. There is simply no space for everybody.
And what's interesting here in this society is that they they made that very obvious. They made that so obvious that they actually create the types of people that will go to specific types of life, you know.
And again, this is horrible, right? Like this is horrible. I mean the reality.
Let's see what else. Okay, let's see. Yeah, it is people, and you know, anyways, I mean, if I could go on and on. But I don't want to go on and on, because I would start to bring stats from social problems in Canada and in the that that that oh, my gosh, no, don't even get in talking about that. But like, you know.
anyways, so people let's move in here. So I would like to cover that interview. So I asked you to watch.
It's kind of a short 20 min something interview with
those Huxley.
and and the reason why there's certain there. Well, there, there's a lot of things that we can talk about this interview. I don't know if you guys had the chance to watch. But one of the things is that the the person.
Mike Wallace, who is interviewing him. His of he was in the fifties a very famous talk show, Guy, you know, just like we have now in the Us. And in Canada. People who interview people like late in those late night shows
this guy was a very famous one, and they interview. I don't know if you guys saw if you got that sense.
Mike Wallace, the interviewer. He was kind of like anxious, and he he did not realize, he the you know, like every time that Huxley was trying to develop some sort of idea.
you know he would be chopped.
and it's almost like Wallace. It was like, how dare you Are you talking about us, us American democracy as if we were a society of control, meaning opposite of a sign of freedom. And and indeed, Huxley was doing that, you know. I don't know. Did you guys get that kind of you know this kind of
this little stations? Okay, great. You got it. So let me see new lands. My education system separates feature.
Yeah. You see, Lucy, not only neither land, but also France Does that Germany does that as well, you know.
and I mean, this is like, you know. This is I mean again, I I can't say that it is what we see, exactly what we've seen brave new world, but it's kind of, you know. We see those kind of you know.
It smells like if I can put that away, you know it smells like almost right. So
so yeah, so you guys got yeah, you guys got it right? So i'm happy that you got it. So let's just move in here, so look
like I don't know if you guys so essentially. Huxley was trying to talk about. You know the rise of totalitarian regime. So he was very. He is personally concerned about that and pro. That's why he wrote that book a brave new world, you know, and and and he is not afraid of the big brother. He's afraid of those invisible forms of power.
So what like? Here are some of the those are the 4
contribute contributing factors to what? To the rise of totalitarian regimes. So here the first factor, according to Huxley, it's over population.
and he calls that an inter personal force. So he says, like, Look, we have a a situation on the world where the world has too many people, and that means that we don't have enough resources, and that means that that that requires
the government. They state to interfere in people's life.
and that for him is very uncomfortable, and I understand that I I can. I can feel that. And going back to my example about the vaccine in Canada, in France and Brazil I mean.
I Personally, I mean. Personally, I kind of I am in pro, I mean I I to call. I take every vaccine I mean if you come, there is vaccine. I just going there, but that's me right, but like, but on a kind of more societal sociological level, I I have sympathy for people who said, Look the Government doesn't. You know I can understand them.
I I don't join the movement. I don't kind of, you know, but I I can. It's almost like I can. I can see where they're coming from. That's how we we phrase it. I can see it.
because, indeed, you know, we had this pandemic, I mean, you know All of a sudden the government had to interfere, and it became mandatory, or it became, you know it made your life very difficult. If you don't take, I mean. So you know. So
so that's one. So that goes back to what I mean. This this idea of some sort of interpersonal force
that becomes a source of control society and the pandemic being the newest one.
you know that changed our lives completely and think about the level of security at the level of data collection that we have right now, even like me, we are recording this lecture, you know. I mean, there's much more. Everything became online, and there's data being connect collected.
Google collects data on on on everything. I mean, it's zoom. I mean, you know all those data collection devices, right? Like another. The second one here tied to second problem, tied to over population is the risk of social unrest, and whenever there is social arrest, law enforcement.
they up their game. That means more surveillance. Okay.
but essentially those 2 factors, I mean, you know, a lack of resource and risk of social unrest.
They kind of invite social intervention. That's what you know, Huxley was saying. And then technology was another factor. I'll get to the chat. And second technology was another factor. So he talks about, you know, like you know, that like like before, you know, we we used to have like, like like in here. They can. Also, you can understand my slide. This terror here is about him talking about like in a society where, you know, like people use technology to make terror
like there, or like to to make people afraid. But now we don't need that anymore. We have technology. Now you know that actually it's almost like it guides your behavior. And he talks a lot about the TV because
this interview from the fifties. So the TV was the main technology at the time. It changed society, you know, like people used to eat together, like, you know, as a family. And all the sudden with the TV people were kind of scattered. Each person had their own TV. They weren't even in the room. I mean, it really changed the side. And not to mention the message the TV TV was able to through TV. I mean, like, you know, like companies, governments, you know, people They were able to broadcast
like messages on a massive scale.
and that would God that can go over, and people's behavior in consumption and education in all aspects of life. Right? So so he talks about technologies, how changes in technologies they actually contribute.
can contribute, and often does, to the rise of totalitarian regimes. And then he talks about also over organizational, or like too much organization, too much like, you know. Institution too much bureaucracy too much, you know. So he talks about. You know
that everything more than ever. There is always a recipe for everything. So all you want to drop a class. Okay, you want to drop a class. You have to do this in that, in that you wanna you want to. You row in a class. You have to do this in that. You want to get your, you know. See a doctor you have to, you know. So everything is very, you know. There's a lot of organization happening society. And and when throughout the institutions and all of those organizations they are collecting data, and they are monitoring EU
right? So. And the last thing that he talks about in his interview is Soma S. O. M. A.
This is actually a drug. So in the book, in brave New World
the characters that book, whenever they were anxious or they were too tired, or they want to have fun they would take Soma. So Soma was this kind of multi functional drug that would make you happy, that that would solve all your problems pretty much.
and I I I I Anyways, I found this really interesting in his interview that he could. He is a Huxley. He was a guy that he himself
he was into drugs. How does he know genetic drugs like, you know, mushrooms that you know, like at the time there was not like stuff from the labs. It was like mostly like mushrooms and and and herbs and mix of herbs. So he was into that kind of stuff, and and
but not only like as a as a as a user but also he was thinking about that and kind of even criticizing it. So he criticized actually drugs, saying that you know that the the the the Pharma industry. Now it's almost like they. They find a solution for every problem that you have. But, Marcella Isn't, that a good thing? Yeah, of course it is right. You know. We don't want to deal. We we want to be healthy, but but on the flip side. You know it's almost like it makes you kind of. You know.
It makes you. You know it makes you kind of calm. It makes you. You know you. You don't, I mean, you know. If you don't go in rally you don't I mean you. You know you're always happy so in that sense. So, you know. Oh, my problem solved and happy! So it kind of you know. It brings this kind of
you know it. It's almost like it compromises your freedom to some it to some degree. That's what he says. Okay, again.
feel free to disagree with him. But but it changes our Member State, you know without us doing it. It doesn't do any harm to us. That's another beauty of the drugs, and also another evil of the drugs. I mean, you know it doesn't do any harm. It doesn't kill us on the opposite. It makes us, you know, happy and and to be happy in a society where you are being controlled all the time. It might not be ideal, because you're not going to complain.
Right? So let me just see here to chat. So I can see.
Yeah. So Raj.
Yeah. E: Exactly. Raj: You're right, because at the time you know, you had, Russia was already like a Communist in Power Empire and America portrayed him itself as like this freedom world where everything's fantastic, where you know, there's space for everybody where everybody can be free. And all of a sudden, there's this guy, you know, this British guy coming to the United States and saying, Look, you know I mean things here are not so free as they look like. So it is about the context.
And another thing I don't like to remember at the end very end of the interview.
They talk about elections, and in in Huxley talks about like, you know, the the politicians in the United States being just like puppets like changing themselves according to the you know, to just to please the population, so they can be voted elected Dean. And then then, like Wallace, the inter viewer was like, oh, you're saying that you know people are, you know people are like that. You know that politicians are lying, and that you know politicians. They don't really care about us. And and oh, Huxley goes like, yeah, that that's what I think. And while she didn't
kind of like that, you know, and
and and indeed people probably, you know, I mean probably you've seen a lot. I mean there, I mean, fake news is the biggest example here of how like you know, that makes a mix of technology and information can change the game in elections. Right? So those fake news they get spread, you know, through Whatsapp groups or or you know. And then that really changed the behavior of people, especially people who do not follow politics very closely, right? So like there's a like both science. Where? Where is the policy, science people
the part of science? I mean Palestine. There is a lot of people doing research on fake news right now, and how you know means information
really undermines democracy, because democracy is about choosing someone, and when you you you your choice is kind of glad. By some sort of lie, you know, or misinformation. I mean, that changed the game in democracy, right? So there's a lot of people in the science. They're big on that right now.
Yeah, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
Raj: I actually love what you said. People look at what Rajas Raj just wrote on the on the chat. You're right, but what you're telling me, and I agree with you. We have to be vigilant, but to be vigilant it means to do self censorship.
so it's almost feel like, feel like we are dropped.
you know. I agree with you, and I am always okay. Let me check this information. Let me see if this is true. Let me check this. Let me check that. But I am doing self surveillance.
I am served, Bailey, my behavior all the time to make sure that i'm not following the wrong kind of crowd, or you know that i'm not taking decisions that I don't. Really, you know that I don't really kind of agreed in the, you know. So so yeah, I know it's it's really nice, you know. So that's that's exactly that.
Okay, so and you see that kind of a finesse
in French finance, or that kind of finishing that you see in like Huxley, you don't really see that in in my opinion this is my opinion.
Okay, and probably after you kind of listening and observing for yourself, maybe you're going to agree. So this finishing this kind of finesse that I see in Huxley. I don't really see that in in in a in Jordan, you know. So they they're both brilliant. But I I find this other guy even.
But again, this is my personal opinion. People You don't have to go with my personal opinion.
Okay, so.
And then also one more thing that I would like to bring up to you in the interview.
Huxley says something like saying, Look
Communist parties across the world again. This is 1950 S. So he says Communist parties across the world.
They are better positioned to deliver.
Totalitarian is.
and I think he is right. I mean, you know, because and he says why he says Communist part is there much more cohesive? They have more internal cohesion. People are more united in their goals, you know. So that is kind of, you know.
And we saw that later in China we saw that in Russia, in in software, in North Korea and Cuba. So yes, you know he is not wrong. But the problem now is that democracies they They can be totalitarian, too.
because and that is kind of changed the like, the like political, social part of science concepts for those of you in Paul Science, I mean, you know that kind of definition of democracy, that kind of definition of totalitarian is when you look at them it's almost like they don't go well together. I mean, it's almost like democracy is the opposite of totalitarianism.
Yeah, but but today
is it? And this is a question for you to think about it and for you to comment on the chat. So you know, so is
democracy, they the the opposite. You know the anti thesis, or the opposite of of of a, of a of a I mean, you know I can see those 2 kinds of like political models
intertwining, you know, getting kind of entangled, you know. I can see that you know a democracy sometimes can become very totalitarian. We'll think about myself that I I don't think I shared with you that I lived one year in Singapore, Singapore. I don't know if you guys ever have ever been to Singapore or
anyways, if you know anything about Singapore, Singapore is really interesting. It is a kind of the democratic regime People can elect. They can choose their leaders, but it's a side of total control people. I was
in Singapore. I had my best ever job. I I used to work in a private sector before.
you know, getting crazy and and resigning and coming to Academy to get a Phd. And become a researcher, but like in Singapore, I was making a lot of money I was. I was living this anyways
from the money. Perspective was a wonderful life. I'll never make that money again in my life as a even as a big big prof in Canada, and and and but I was miserable, because that's I I hate living there. It's total control.
If you do anything wrong, anything, let's suppose you you know you. You're chewing a gun, a gun, and you're not supposed to that in Singapore. You throw that gum in a you know, in the the the garbage. Some police officers gonna come from nowhere and talk to you. Look you're not supposed to do that here. This is Singapore. I mean it's total control. You know
It's a, and it's the democratic regime, and it. It it it it's, it's. It gets very totalitarian, because I mean it's almost like it suffocates, you, you know.
Here
people
life in brave new World.
It is a dictatorship, but it is a dictatorship that relies on consent of the road. Okay, so it is like.
you know, even like sync up, or today. Some people in both science. They argue that Singapore is like more, much more. It's like a tick. It's it's not really a democracy. It's like a dictatorship and and and and it relies on on the consent of the world. The like. Most the people who live in Singapore, they they Singaporeans, they get to be very happy and proud of your country, you know, because it's ever it's super clean. It's super
everything works I've never. It's like crime is like 0. They have a 0 prime rate. It's just like amazing. I mean to see.
So let's see what My, if you say data collection through surveillance makes it easier for people to circulate fake news, because sometimes static news rainforests. Oh, yeah, and and and definitely, definitely, you know definitely, because I mean, you know, you know you if you want to put something on Facebook.
something like you know about anything you know any any like, you know you just all you have to do is just to pay a couple of $100, and you get that profile of people who like specific things. And then you feed that. You know that system right? Like you use that data collection. You use data collection to.
you know, to like to target the right kind of people who will buy into that. And and but then
here there is a policy
that we discussed earlier in the text. I mean, sometimes it doesn't work that that doesn't work, but like sometimes surveillance works in a way that I mean when I use surveillance data to target you
and and and then I I i'm also produces like data with that. So that data that I'm producing is kind of it's kind of it's kind of thought to logical. It's kind of you know it's like a a dog, a it's tail, or running after it's tail. So it's like there's a topology within the data. So it's like so, and then you know that data becomes not very good in terms of quality. So you know, that goes back to one of the fallacies that we studied.
So so thank you for your comment. I mean nice comment there.
Yeah. So I mean.
like I'll tell you here, Jessica
in Singapore, for example, or i'll give you the the example that I know best, because Singapore, I live there, but I never did research in there. In China I lived 7 years, and I did a lot of research. So in China, for example.
people
they are. They know that the government is controlling everything that they right on. There we chat. We checked like a little app like whatsapp it's just like Whatsapp, and also it's a multi functional app so that people know that the government is watching them that there's people that you know are doing censorship on those apps.
But you know people say you know i'd rather be like that, because you know it's safe. At least I know that. You know they are watching me, but also they are watching people. Who do you know.
child, pornography? They are watching people. Who do you know who are using the apps to plot crimes? I mean, you know. So they're willing to kind of afraid of it's a trade off, and here is interesting
dictatorships. They usually work out well.
If the Government is able to control the economy very well in a way that everybody has a job, or everybody has that sense that they are, you know, climbing up the ladders. You know that they are getting somewhere, that you know, if the government can produce that that kind of economy
people. Usually they are willing to to to trade their privacy and their data. But if.
if if that is not possible, you know. Then people start to complain, and then the government has to become harsher.
The that dictatorship becomes more kind of an external kind of you know, big broader on people. So when we look at China from 1,978 today, or even 1978, to the beginning of the 2,000
people in China. They were making lots of money.
lots of money, and everybody was super happy about it, I mean. So people didn't care much about the Government control in your lives. But today's kind of start I can see in China things starting to derail, because the economy economy is not doing as well as used to be.
People are starting, you know, to have their children's school, and then their children graduate just like you guys, and then, you know they finish school and they but they can't find a job, you know. So things are starting to get kind of a little bit more, you know people are not very happy with the Government, and in the new, that this President of China, Cgp. What is he doing? He's pressing?
He's kind of turning his turning. That type of totality like of oppression.
you know. Kind of it's it's kind of you know. Let's let the big broader outside the cage. So there is this movement in China.
Yeah. Usually when Yes, Jessica, when we look back at all the dictatorships in the world, and how they evolved over time we see that, you know, like lack of resources. Economy.
you know it becomes a an an up an an issue, and it leads to stuff to like like it. It leads to riots, rallies, and you know, and
very like, you know, sometimes most sometimes more fast, sometimes more gradually. But it usually, you know when we look at the end of dictatorship regimes, it has to do with the economy and the economy going down. You know Latin America is an example for for you, you know, like the like Brazil Chile. You know all the countries in Argentina all the countries in Latin America.
Yeah, exactly
like you're talking about China right like you, Lucy. Are you talking about China?
Yes.
let's see. Just see. Yeah, okay, China people from from like 78 to 2,000. They were growing 7,
you know, and then and then it dropped, you know, and then it dropped like 2, 5, 6, you know, like 3.3, 3 something was even before it was like.
because China has 2 historical period, like China, from 1,949, all the way to 79. It was a very close to, you know, like it was a very traditional kind of communism.
And then in that time, like the the growth rates, they were not good. They were like 2, 3, 4, and then, after you know, like 1978, they opened up to the world
China joined the World Trade organization, and they became a player, and then, like it, became, like, you know, 9, 7, 9. It would even almost to 10, and then now it drop back again. I haven't checked in the last 2 years how much? But I think it's around, for I heard about it. It's like 4 or 5, but it, you know I I would have to change. Check it right now.
Okay, I'll get to you in a second. Jenna. I have. I see your question here. Just let me just finish here. So dictatorship okay, relies on consent people. It's almost like people start to love their slavery and that it comes from you know this line comes from Huxley, too, you know. And and then my question to you
is brave New world compatible with democracy. I will say yes.
and probably all the offers that you're gonna read in this course, including Dr. Hagerty, I mean. Yes, they would say yes, you know, and not completely. Maybe not exactly the same. But but yes, you know. And and is there a space for totalitarian is in in democratic regimes? Yes.
so those questions, those 2 questions here are for you to think about them and and consider them, you know, in your life, not only for this class, i'm Just see here again. So Jana put the rise of fast, as I mean, for in 1930 S. And for it to be a kind of example this.
because before the world can it became
for? Oh, look, Jenna, here, let's let's not just say something for you
like fastest regimes, especially like those that we had in Europe like Italy, Germany, you know those Spain, Portugal. They are like there, like a whole area in itself. So you know, which is not my air of special specialization. However, I can say something to you.
I think that in both cases
you know what did like, you know Again, i'm not in a specialist on that i'll let you give you my my my view here. So when we look back, I think that the thing that actually
triggered that triggered that
was
was like his movements in society at that time 1910, 1920, those move movements that were kind of segregating
humans. So all of a sudden, like like like until the end of the nineteenth century. We were talking about
the human being, the human. We have a very humanistic
approach to social movements, and that had to lift the enlightenment. Okay? And then, in the 1910 twenties we start to kind of dissect. Now we have women. Now we have, you know, like now we have like sorts of all sorts of minorities in in Europe was Jewish, and then I mean, I think, that also also plays a factor.
You know that kind of
the like dissecting humans, which I totally understand why we did that because certain humans, humans, they're not all the same, and and and humans, all specific callers of a specific countries of specific, You know they are. They. They experience different lives just because of who they are. But but you know, so that that's one side. But on the other side you know that kind of dissecting of the human into pieces
that contribute to this idea. Okay, the Jewish are terrible. You know the Catholic are terrible, and the Lgbtq. 2 people are also telling me, because those are the they. They were the people who were target
by. You know the the the fascist regimes in in Europe, not only the Jewish, but also Catholic people. Lgbtq. 2 plus people. Now we call LGBT, but gay people or homosexuals. That was the language of the at a time right like. So so we have. So I would have to kind of.
you know. Give you more and discuss more, and also me study more for us to, you know. Talk about that specific, you know, when we go specific into the regimes in Europe. But your consideration, Jen, is really important, you know, because
a lot of I mean still a lot of what we are talking here. You know the idea of classifying people, the idea of surveillance that it was applicable at that time. So when we think about there was surveillance for people who are Jewish, or who Catholic or or or homosexual, or people who had any kind of illness by the way.
Right? So so there was surveillance for them. There was specific like protocols for them. So what you're saying here is extremely important.
exactly, definitely. But even like at that time those movements
like those movements that i'm talking about, that they kind of lay the groundwork for this division of human beings.
those movements they were actually they were actually very like
they were very liberal the beginning, You're very liberal. And then there was twist, I mean, like you know, like fascist, they they they kind of appropriated from those movements they approved, they, there was an appropriation of those ideas, and that in a tweet a per very upper version of the the the ideas. They were perverted. Almost okay.
So let me go back and hear people
and see what else. Okay, so here fake meals. This is something here for you to consider as well. So look that they can use as an example. I mean, we. We talk a little bit about that, and and and fake news happened
in in 1,984, and also in brave New World, because it's almost like you twist events, I mean in in 1984 fake news was obvious, because, even, like you know, the the main character. He was like Wilson, he was editing history right? He was editing. He's straight to make.
to patch to everything. Looks like we any kind of contradiction. All we were enemy. Now we're friends, so i'm gonna go back and add it all those articles that said that we were enemies. So so fake news is something that I mean, of course, now we see it. But the idea that concept of kind of you know, you know that is something that we're in those books before you know.
and fake news can twist. You can really part or pervert or change people's people's opinion. And in the case of democracy you do persuade people to vote according to you know, or against whatever news right like according to the news or against the news.
And I talked about that. So TV, I mean Huxley didn't know anything about the Internet because obviously there was no Internet at the time. So it was TV. So, and he was talking. He he didn't say that in the interview, but he almost said it was like, You know there is a new, because the guy Wallace says so. Do you think you are being brainwashed?
And then he says, yeah to some extent. Yes, you know. And then, like Wallace, Yes, him to give an an example, and then he starts to give an example. Wallace Wallace cuts him off like, you know. But the example was going to be about TV like TV, kind of, you know, brainwashing us at that time. And now it'll be the Internet fake news, right? So
And then something very nice that Huxley said. An interview is that
we humans.
and this applies to ever I mean anywhere. We humans were obsessed with power.
One of our biggest fashions is power. It can be big power, or it can be just you trying to. You would, you know, convince your brother or your sister of something?
It can be you trying to convince your parents. I mean, this is power people. So we are obsessed about trying to get to make it according to our to our own ways. Right? So this is part of the human nature, and that's Why, there is a very famous political social scientist, a political scientist.
Her name is Hannah.
I'm. Just right here for those of you who are in the
Hannah didn't just. I don't know how to pronounce her name actually, but it's I mean it's Hannah, and I mean in Portuguese. We say Hannah and I don't know in English, but it might be about the same. So she was a Jewish woman. Actually she escaped NASA when she she finished her life in the United States very famous call, or I think she was a pro at Chicago or something.
But anyway, she has a book where she talks about it. She's it's called for about the name of the book a Red. So it's been like over 20 years.
anyway. So we a cold human condition, or, if you are interested. Write me an email. Tell you I can. I can search that. But in this book, like in this book that it's one of her most famous book. She talks about humans as being political beings.
and and why political beings. Because it's about power. We crave power, right? We create power. We want to show people. I'm gonna show you who I am. You know you did that to me. I'm gonna give it back to you. It's all about power. So we we kind of crave that right? So
Oh, yeah, Jessica: yeah, Jessica here asking about the hostility in danger, I would say so. I mean, it's almost like Wallace is kind of a little bit brainwashed. He's he's blind. He doesn't see what's going on right like, and I can understand. I I have some and puffy for him, because that was 1950,
and and in the fifties and Huxley he was a man of so much ahead of his time right like even me. I think if I read that I mean you think about I mean, that interview is very futuristic.
You know it's unbelievable To think that that guy thought.
you know. You know he described things that are happening today, you know. So
okay, so, people here.
this is just a question for you.
and that's that. I also appeared in the interview.
Is freedom really necessary?
Do we need freedom?
And then I mean, this is a question I mean you could say, oh, we don't
you like people in brave new World. They are happy, and they don't have freedom. They have choice. They have some autonomy some choices. We thought that within the parameters, but they don't really have freedom. But my question for you and I mean, obviously this is not an exam question. This is for you to ask to think about. Do you think that? Is it necessary? I mean.
probably for those of you who at who saw the interview. You know what he said, but what matters to me now is what you say?
Where is everybody? I mean? Do you guys believe that is, do you think, I mean, think, think, think for a second.
you know. Is it really necessary, you know.
So it depends it on the definition of freedom like okay, Freedom means any removal of any kind of control, any kind of surveillance, any kind of you know, monitoring
joy like Jessica or everybody else. The removal of that's what they were talking about in this interview. The removal of any kind of surveillance, any kind of data, collection, any kind of monitoring.
is it? This is? It is is necessary. I mean.
yeah, we'll see, you know.
And that's exactly what Huxley said.
you know. Well, he was like, Well, you know. Yeah, for innovation. Yes. And why? Innovation is important, because that's how we that's how we transform society.
We through swarms, we humans. We transform this organization called society.
with our creativity, with innovation.
Again, you know we may. It's almost like you know we may. We can give up freedom.
but that would be. Let's suppose you are.
You are. Let's suppose you are a very right wing economist, and all you care about is capitalism and profitability.
You will love freedom. Because you're you're gonna say no. We need some freedom because you know it's freedom is an ovation. Innovation is profitability. I have an interview that I like a lot that I mean. It's not a that I have. It is on Youtube, but I have saved an interview with the
Steve Jobs, the guy from from apple.
And sometimes I play that interview in my class because the apple guy, Steve Jobs, he says, Look.
what is the secret of Apple? Because everybody wants to know what the secret is. This company is just like, you know. It's a huge company, I mean it's. This is an example for everybody, and then he says this: this: the secret is teamwork and collaboration.
And then people say, okay, elaborate. Then he says, through teamwork and and collaboration, we have brainstorming. We have diversity, and then we have innovation.
you know. So
so you know. So
again. So you feel, if you like the economy you want to make money. You're gonna appreciate some freedom, and if you are liberal, if you are on a liberal side of the political scale, you're going to appreciate some freedom, too, because you know. So, for different reasons, people might argue different reasons. But probably everybody's gonna say, yeah, it's necessary.
Finance is saying, I feel like freedom is the true sense can be scary given. Yeah, Well, it is, and people freedom is scary. It is scary. Think about little times where you know you had some. So well, I'm going to give you my example of the pro
when I tell people okay, like I've done this like very early on.
you know, in my career here in Canada. Then I I stopped doing that, but I would give kind of very open. It says it's like just right, me and say.
and people would freak out, and I that's why I stopped doing that because they students would complain to me that complain about me. They would give me a head. They they would call the you know, the the, the, the the chair, the department they would call the police on me. I am kidding, not the police, but like pretty much, almost like calling the police, because you know how. There, you don't give me parameters. You're not going to tell me what phone size I should be writing. You're not going to tell me what the caller phones, or whatever whatever whatever that I mean, you know, like, You know I I did that like twice when I first
I'm going to start teaching in 2,01617, and the of a this is just writing an essay on any topic.
and then people people are like, what is this a neighborhood departure? And you can't do that. And I understand, because the control is the bureaucracy. But I I you know, just to give you one example. So we freak out when we don't have parameters right like
Raj. I think it's necessary, because the ideal of freedom itself appeals to our very 5 as as as in nature as human beings. We all want to be able to do something we desire. Yeah.
yeah, I I I completely agree with you, you know.
Yeah, it should be some restrictions, Kathleen, saying, yeah, it's good, but with restrictions, Matthew
Major corporations they hate for. Oh, yeah, they do, because they want the Government to to control for them. That's why they lobby right, like. If you see the log of visiting. If you see the and i'm not kidding, you can go right now on Google and and pull the log
for for people who visit Congress in the United States. Like all the the members of Parliament, you're gonna see that top number one is Google. And then Facebook. Meta right, Facebook. You're gonna see all the big companies like lobbying with the State. So you're very right, you know. Yeah, you're right, Jessica.
Yeah, so it's it's kind of yeah. I I agree with you, Jessica. Here
in the chaos. Yeah, some some of salmon. Yeah, you know.
Oh, good. I'm. Gonna take that. Take note of that. The Burge.
Okay.
yeah, people, you guys are very right, and i'll see. I'm reading you here on the chat.
Yeah. Hj: again. And then, Matthew.
Yeah.
exactly. Yeah, you know it. It's true. You're very right, Matthew. When we we start to think how much surveillance we are, and then we start to think about freedom. I mean, we don't think about freedom until then, right like.
So let's see what else. Perhaps there should be surveillance.
Yeah, I agree. But, Lucy, you can't have you in English. We say I learned this a couple of years ago. You can't have your cake and eat at the same time, you know, Lucy doesn't go that way. That's the problem, you know.
because here there's a danger for that that kind of you know. You. Okay, let's now, you know. Do some DNA thing and then see who's gonna be a criminal? You can get crazy here, you know.
So but very nice, very insightful comment.
But you you're right, you know. I I wish that that would be possible without producing discrimination and re reproducing fascism in society. You know.
like Nazis and fascism.
Yeah, and you're right, Jessica. The real issue is the distinction between person and private public freedom. And that's the thing I mean, I think, for us people.
Thank you very much for your comments. I see here.
Oh, Valentine's also say he's talking about the birds, and it's really good. Okay, look people, you're very right for us. I mean, Obviously, we're not going to solve the problems of the world in this class. But what we want is to kind of, you know, is to to, you know, to. I want you guys to kind of think about those things, because if you are aware, I mean.
you know I I don't know for me at least I feel better about like knowing those things and knowing. Oh, this is this is this kind of surveillance and governance. Here's another kind here. That's what's happening here that's other thing happening. I mean, I feel more. I know, empowered.
Perhaps you know. Let me get my other slide. Hold on a second. Don't go anywhere because it's to have time, and we have another slide to go. So
this one here.
Where are you guys? Okay, Here
people get some coffee because we still have some stuff to cover. Okay. So i'm going to my second set of slides.
Let me see where that they are.
Okay.
Oh, gosh, where is it?
Sorry? Technical things here?
Okay. Here.
let's see if you see me. If you still see me. If you don't see me, please tell me. Okay. So if you don't see me.
Okay. So look what we're gonna do is
we're going to talk about the loose
in a, in a, in a chapter that's called postscript on the size of Control.
And then we're gonna start talking about full call, and I will finish who call next class. And why I'm gonna do that because I kind of knew that would be out of time.
and I want to cover full call in more detail, because for those of you who are going to do a masters degree in sociology, or in in in public health, or in in in both science or in anthropology, even, you know full call is a very important to offer. So I want to be more. You know I wanna you know. So
take a little bit of time. So next class we're going to finish fu call. We're going to do pretty much. Do Fu, go and start the privacy Chapter. Okay, the privacy part. Okay. So look
here. There is this article that I ask you to read it's called Postscript on the Societies of control that was publishing French in 1990
by a guy named Julie or Jill. However, you want to pronounce his name, feel comfortable with him because he has a very nice, you know. Text. So Joe or Gil Gil Giles. Okay, so that's his name or to lose. I don't know. However, you want to call it
so, and in English it was published in 1,982 in English, and then 1,995 again. So it became a very famous article in English. Okay, but ironically, a lot of the people we said surveillance. They don't know this.
Okay, they don't know this guy. I shall tell you that the and focal they were very good friends, they thought, at the same school in Paris, and they were actually good friends. Okay. So.
And they knew each other very well. Here's a picture for you. So this guy was born in 25. And he died in 1,995. I was 15 years old. So now you guys know that I was born in 1,980. So this guy, actually he has been to my country several times. You know. He's a very famous guy in both science, although I think that in in Canada. People in policy, science doesn't really study him, you know. I mean it's more like European kind of Paul Science.
Look.
if you see the the article that I gave you to read. It is organized into 3 parts 3 parts.
and I would like to kind of break it down for you, and to see how much time I have. Okay, Have 10 years. Oh, shoot.
Okay, people, Part Number one. He gives a little bit of a history
background for you. Okay? And then what he's gonna do in this part Part Number one is he's gonna make a distinction. Take note of that.
There is makes a distinction about, or between society, of sovereignty
and disciplinary society. Okay, and those concepts, those are actually concepts. Societies of sovereignty is a concept is a full coding concept and disciplinary society is another photon concept.
I know that by now you should expect me to give me the concept for call.
He has never written this concept. So he talks about it all over his books. So there is not like one single place where he defines. Okay, so i'm not going to give you a definition, because there is not one single definition. But there are ideas that are like you to kind of understand. So society of sovereignty
is the idea where it is a society where punishment.
And here you will read punishment as surveillance as control, as monitoring as data collection.
Okay, so remember, like you know punishment here in Foucault.
you know it's surveillance is monitoring data collection.
Why, i'm talking about full call, because in the list text he mentions who call. He creates a dialogue with full call. Okay, so look, punishment is visible, and it is cruel.
It is by an external figure.
you know, so that kind of punishment. That's really someone telling you what to do
kind of killing you in public for Foucault that is a society of sovereignty, Marcella. How about 1984. Would that be a society of sovereignty?
Yes, it would be kind of a mix. There is a lot of elements in that book that is, society of sovereignty, like the big, broader, punishing you and telling you what to do and and threatening you.
But there are also elements of us, a disciplinarian society. I'll get there before I see the chat look, so punishment is visible. The goal. Take note. I'm gonna ask this in the exam the goal of the society of sovereignty for full call is.
is is is to rule, that
is, to produce rulings on death, to decide who lives and who dies.
and also to text life. So it's almost like Look, Imagine the best image that I can give you is a queen or a king
faxing you telling you you're gonna die. I'm gonna chop your head in the in the guillotine, and French is guilty, I think, in English. The same word. I'm gonna chop your head, like, you know, and i'm gonna text you. So if you're producing something, i'm gonna i'm gonna you know charge tax.
So that's what like when we look at medieval Europe. That's the kind of society that we had like. You know the King, that doesn't like you, the Queen doesn't like you. They chop your head right? So i'm just see to check
and and think I your comment here, Jacob. Very good. So Jacob's talking about the amount of freedom in Canada.
Things are in order, you know. We do have like, you know, systems. We've problems, but overall, you know.
we have the law.
Yeah, I I you're very right, you know. And like, let's see how I also think that give away certain freedoms. Yeah, you have to give up. Yeah, I I see exactly what you're saying.
and you're I. I agree with you, and he goes. You go saying last and brave new world, but I think we need we need freedom with communication. I agree. I agree. I just want to bring something to you for you to think, Jacob very nice comment
like now, we always think about amount of freedom.
Try to think about types of freedom.
You know
me as a researcher. The more I do research and surveillance I I that always go for types like, okay? Is it about amount, or is it a but because, like what is too much in Canada can be too little elsewhere to little elsewhere. So it goes for the types, you know. It helps with the analysis. Okay.
I mean suggestion. Feel free to, you know, but a very nice comment.
and I have someone here saying.
You know something else, Jessica, You can read this message away.
Oh, gosh.
okay, Jessica. So control death and tax life. Exactly that. So I know that my time is always up.
I used to have 5 min. I was gonna use it. Yes, Jessica, you're right. So the the goal of sovereignty. Society is to control death or to you know, control that and text life. Look, I have this image here. I know it's kind of a little bit. Oh, my gosh! But just to kind of illustrate, this is the society
of sovereignty.
It's the idea of like, let's suppose I mean this guy here is just executing the order of some king, some queen, and very visible it. It's very cruel right like public execution, public execution, like you know, or like. I don't know if you guys know, but like in Europe in medieval times.
the only people who are allowed to hunt. Obviously, at the time there was no supermarket, so people had to hunt.
The only people allowed to hunt was the members of the royal family and the clergy members of the church. If someone who was a common, an ordinary person, was caught hunting, that person would be killed.
Imagine: i'm talking about medieval times. Is not that long ago. Okay, so that society was society of sovereignty
Again, let me use my little time that I have.
And then we have. We have a disciplinary society also by full call in disciplinary society punishment. And again, punishment means surveillance, monitoring governance data collection. It's no longer a spectacle. It's not about torturing people in a visible way.
Punishment it becomes a different kind of power.
Okay, but myself, tell me what exactly what kind of power it's called discipline.
So you punish. Punishment is no longer violence against people, or texting or or killing people. But punishment means disciplining people. Okay.
and and all the disciplining happens according to the law to the bureaucracy, to rules right? So there is a whole system and control
control like governance. It happens through an environment of constraints and
privations, challenges, you know, obligations, prohibitions. It's almost like you know. It's like almost like a true one. Show where you put some, you know, obstacles, some constraint, some privacy. I don't know if you guys saw this movie. It's a old move. Truman show like it's this guy that lives in a kind of you know, made up a fake
stage. It kind of life, and he doesn't know that he's in a stage of life. So it's like, you know this is the environment where there's the deprivations, constraints, controls, prohibitions, and and you know that's the how the control happens, you know, and the goal. I'm going to finish. I'm going to wrap up here the goal
of disciplinary society is to organize life. Look
it, contrast. One is to, you know, rule, control life. The other one is to organize you. Don't cure. No, everybody lives. Everybody, you know, is gonna be alive here. There's no people being killed, you know, but the goal is to organize that life.
And when there, when did we transition from
the side of sovereign, she, just society of to the Disciplinary Society? We did that transition in the in the eighteenth century.
Okay, according to full call.
and that the according like the actual event, empirically speaking, was the creation of the criminal code in France. Okay, the creation, and then the the reforms like there was a series of reforms, you know, of the criminal code. So that's where he puts it like, empirically speaking. Okay.
So look, that's what I'd like you to keep for now. So again we are not talking. We're talking about full call, but because the Lewis brings that up. So you know. So keep this in mind, for now there will be a third type of society
which is called Societies of control. And this is the idea of the loose. So Foucault had the idea to science of sovereignty, disciplinary society. And then the loose came up with a new type of society called Society of Control
Societies of Control and Surveillance Governance is always different. Okay.
so is this clear people.
We're going to pick it up from this slide next week. Okay.
let me see. So I think that's it for today. I would like to thank you very much. You guys have a nice nice
afternoon or evening. If you have any question, please don't go away with questions. Stay here. Check with me. I'm here for you. Okay, let's cause yeah. So we're gonna to. We're discussing the loose. And then next class we're going to do an opticism. Okay, Kathleen delays today, starting and then
an opticism. I will catch up because I do have space in the syllabus to catch up. So don't worry about it. We're gonna get there. But is it making sense to you. Let me know. Here
you guys have. Oh, yeah, Have a wonderful weekend people.
You guys take care. Have a wonderful weekend. Let's just stop sharing with stop recording.
So.

<h1>Jan 24</h1>
  <p>
"Hey, folks, Welcome back to sociology. 2 to 6. Do you hear me? Do you see me? Well.
okay, so that's great. Okay. So let's start. So, first of all, let me just say a few words about the exam.
My exams. They are usually easy
and easy means what it means that I test.
I I test like the like staff from from the readings, and also from the lectures.
but it usually is that overlap. I go, like you know, because I mean the way that I I try to do My lectures is like. I know those readings that you guys are reading, and I I try to summarize them to you. A threat to, you know, to kind of, you know, like amplify or highlight whatever is important. And then those are the things that i'm going to be testing you on on. So I don't do. I do not do those things such as I go into reading, and then I find something deep, deep, very specific, down there. And I ask you that.
Okay? So I don't do that kind of stuff. So you know. So my questions. They always go back to the content that that was, you know, that was covered in class so quite often People ask me. Is it enough just to kind of sit in class, and then i'm going to test. Well.
I would say that if Don't do any any reading, and it just come, and and you know it. It depends. If you have a lot of good notes, I mean, if you actually took notes and you've understood correctly, maybe you know you can get away with that. But ideally you should kind of read, and if it's too much for you, what you're gonna do is when you're reading.
Try to kind of okay. Oh, she said this in class. Oh, she she brought this up, and then, you know, so kind of like, you know.
focus on whatever you know I am discussing class. Is this clear to you guys to have any question about the exam. So usually my people, they don't really complain about it, you know, like they say over I was fair fair game like that's what I hear a lot, you know. But let me see If you guys have questions.
don't hesitate to put your question up there, or you know, or put in the chat.
No, no, no class, no. Our Our first exam.
It's going to be February. Not not yet. Okay. Yes, exactly, Grace. Thank you very much. Fab: 16. Okay. So you don't have an exam to then.
Is that okay? Okay, Any more questions People are concerned. Honestly.
again, you know, use my lectures as a guideline, you know.
or to study like kind of, you know, if you get to something very specific and or something that I did not touch in class touch on in class, i'm not going to ask anything that relate to that, you know.
and if because usually what I do is once I finish preparing the exam, I I kind of read the exam. And I I kind of ask myself, Marcel, is this fair?
Does it conform and comply to whatever you said in class? If I find something in there, that's kind of more specific. That was like more in the reading, and was not so much in class. I actually tell people I I send you guys an email. Say, look, you know, mind whatever like, you know, if there's something i'll, I'll I'll let you know. And and ironically, even when I tell people a lot of people that just don't care, and they come back to me later. Oversell this. You never said this in class yet, but I do remember. Check! Check your mailbox. You're going to find something for
for me, and then they go back and say, oh, yeah, i'm sorry I forgot, or I didn't see it, you know. So you know communication people in honesty and integrity. This is kind of you know. I appreciate that so, and I expect that. So I I appreciate that from my side, you know.
No, I would not do a review session, Jessica. But I will write you an email kind of outlining the main topics. Kind of kind of you know, kind of. You know, within this topic that you have to study. I will kind of, you know, gear you a little bit more re size. So you don't have too much travel. Okay.
it's kind. I mean, it's no Valencia. Those questions that you see on the classes. Just simple questions for the the whole course. Okay.
let's see. There's this is already been answered for a month. Exam: okay. The first Exam: a lily. First exam is multiple choice, and the last one is multiple choice. And then you have an assignment.
Okay.
so multiple choice, multiple choice.
And you do have some simple questions for you.
Not necessarily. Some of them, I mean. No. Those simple questions I cover them in, i'm. Covering them in class.
Actually, they are all in class.
Any other question people concerned, I mean, share your concern. Don't. Don't take your concern at all.
Don't. Take your concern home, because if you do that, it gives stomach, cake, headache, and eventually depression. So just throw it out here. So you you know. So you're going to go home concern free. You know
you you again. You have to study. You have to take notes, but there's no like, you know it's not like a class that it's too hard, or that you know that I make it like You know, my goal here is to actually transfer the knowledge that I have to you, and in a clear fashion, in a way that you actually learn. So that's the goal. So okay.
if you have any question about the exam, you throw in there. I'll go back that later.
So last time we met, so we we we. We saw some literature on on surveillance.
and now we are going more to the social science literature, and we were discussing last time this guy named Jill. He is a French scholar. He was friends with full call. Okay.
And today we're gonna see full call. But like, let's just finish covering the lose. Okay. So here, less less time we met. I told you that we have 3 types of society. Okay, 3, to take note of that, because that will be on the exam, 3 types of society. So we have societies of sovereignty.
And this is an invention by who? By delays, No, by football. Actually, okay. So Society of sovereignty and we have something that Fuko also pointed, and it's called disciplinary Society. Okay. So what is the difference? What is the difference between those 2 society? Take note of that difference? So in society, in sovereignty, science or society of sovereignty. Power is visible, punishment is visible. Surveillance is visible.
Okay, and it is a society that that has 2 main goals. It it it'd be, create it, create rules on death. So it decides when people are killed and it takes life. You guys remember that from next last class is it clear for you. Can I go ahead.
Tony. I'll get you exam again later. Let's just move ahead, and then I talk about the exam again. Okay. So you guys are okay. So far, society of sovereignty.
Can we go on? Okay, Good. So disciplinary society, it is a society that's different, that instead of like regulating that
it manages. Take note of that verb manages life and death
in that society of the Disciplinary Society. You don't get rid of anybody. You don't kill people. What you do is you manage life? Okay? So how do you manage? I mean, you create an environment. You use bureaucracy. You can create rules to manage people.
Okay. So this society, according to like to full call, not the list, but according to full code. The last year is just doing a summary of Foucault. So in disciplinary societies, according to full call, I mean they were born they those societies They appeared
in the eighteenth century. We're going to see more about how those sites appeared, and how to kind of, you know, quotes custom, but so far so good, so in in power, in disciplinary societies is is
power in disciplinary societies. It's, it's called discipline.
It's not like a power that that goes in your face that torches you and punishes you. No, it is a power that like makes you comply somehow. So this kind of power creates an environment just like a playground, you know. Think of a playground an environment that controls you.
you know. So it makes you jump and makes your client and makes you go down. You know it's almost like an that kind of environment, and that environment controls you
and and surveillance in that in that society as joy is invisible. Okay, however, we're going to talk more about the visibility in visibility. Kind of type of me. But yes, surveillance is more invisible, and also it's more
self kind of you know it's it's it's self censorship. So you know what you have to do. We talked about that because I mean the literature in the novels that we discussed Revenue world especially. It's more like that. Okay, so far, so good. Can I go ahead? People? Can I go ahead? People.
yes or no, but only chat for me clear so far, 2 types of society. Yes, Jessica, you're right. Okay, I see you here. You're good. So look
now. This is this picture. Here's just to kind of illustrate society of sovereignty by full call. It's this idea that you know someone is kind of just making decisions on life, on, on, on, on death. Okay when to kill someone. So so you keep in mind, Marcella. Is there a picture for Society of discipline?
Disciplinary Society Know that? Well, I didn't. I didn't. I will give you one later. But if I if I am to give you a picture, I would actually put a playground for you.
you know, if you guys could.
if you had to replace my picture instead of a playground for societies of discipline, what would you put? What image do you think that would kind of illustrate a society that is a society they wanted the second one here, you know a society and disciplinary society.
Come on, People in the chat. Think quick school probably. Yes, school would work.
you know, if you if you want to go broader a little bit. What kind of I mean, you know, I mean give me a kind of more broader kind of picture like, you know I I gave you playground. You guys gave me school. What else
Society about science. Then it's too broad, right, like too broad like you could workplace, maybe. Yeah. But give me something more concrete concrete that you can actually touch, you know.
Come on, folks.
we gotta move. So I want to expedite you
6 streets potentially. Yeah. But give me something even more kind of obvious, like, you know.
plagiarizing. Probably. Yeah, something like that kind of social order, you know. You could give me a camera if you want.
Perhaps I I I wonder what you know? I would give you a camera
because the camera is that idea that I mean it's there. The camera changes your behavior. You know that you are being under surveillance. A traffic light will be a nice one, you know. You know that you have to stop.
I mean, obviously, there is always surveillance, but you know that you have to stop sports team. Well, yes, because there is competition. There is data collection. There is monitoring, you know. Speed speed trap. Yes, okay, you guys got it. I'm happy that, you know. You know you got what i'm talking about. Okay, so look
So
So again. So so like. Now, like we are getting more to what you know like the most to lose. He came up
with an additional kind of society, the third one. The third one was by the list, the first, the second was by foul, and the third was by Liz. So the Liz. What he said was that you know what we have today.
It's not this in his interpretation. It's not disciplinary societies, just like Foo call, said he, said. No, people. You know what for Court told us.
It's it's behind us already. We already have another kind of society, and he labeled Take note of that. He labeled that society societies of control.
Okay, so what is the difference difference between the 2 of them? The which 2 of them, the disciplinary society and the assign of control. So for for full call
in a disciplinary society, what you have is a bunch of institutions. This the family, the school, the workplace, the hospital, you know, like like many institutions, the government and those institutions, they are what he called spaces of enclosure.
So it's almost like that. You move from institution. One you go to you. You move from this institution to the second institution, to the third institution, to the fourth institution, and in the end, but within inside of those institutions you are being controlled.
So control is kind of it. It's side. So taking out of that control is tied to the institutional setting. Okay, so
meaning that when you change from one institution to the other institution, you you change the control apparatus.
Basically, is it clear for you guys? So far, so you go from family. You have one type of control, and then you move to the school. You have another kind of control, and then you go to the workplace. You have another kind of control. Okay, so that's that's like, for that is what is for full call. Okay for disciplinary societies.
And then what to to this is gonna tell us is that Look, this is behind us. This is Bs already. Now, what we have is side of control. You.
e. When you like. What we have now is, you go from institutional one to institution, 2, 3, 4, 4, and then the control never stops. It is continuum.
There's a you know. It's continuous
as well.
So it's not like like it's not. It's not on team. You all look in English. We have those 2 words: Here.
check the chat. Here we have the worry on Tina Wall, and we have the word on team new us. So one is continual, another one is is continuous because it never stops. So that's what the Lewis said about today's society.
So you, you you guys gave me a bunch of examples to you straight. You know a a, a a disciplinary society. Give me now some image, a concrete image, to illustrate a society of control where you know where control is continuous. Give you some image that could illustrate that
Sasha. Yes, they are up.
They are, you know. Don't need their only class. Let's see what people say. Internet Yes, Valencia. Wonderful, wonderful people you got. You got it. Look
cell phone, Internet. You know.
you know the online world, You know, I would give you one right here. I'll give you 1 one example right here.
Credit card
credit card.
This is like continuous. I can. I can spend money at your way at workplace like the canteen. It doesn't matter. I can go to, You know, France, Brazil. You know Japan, China and continuous control here. Okay.
So I think that the list probably was kind of right. So if we're gonna do kind of a evolution of society, we start with the of with an image, let's say, of the king, the king, science who dies and who lives, and then the next one we can use the camera, and then the next one. We can use the Internet if you want to. Kind of, you know, plot kind of a chart.
You know what I mean like. So you can see the evolution of how society transformed over the years.
Is that clear? People?
I need this to be like. I need you to know this thing, and I need you to know this thing in a way that you know you're going to be able to talk about and explain that to someone
good to our willingness. It is usually Jessica for Jessica's question.
In both societies, like disciplinary societies and science of control. We we are willing to get to give our information. Okay, usually.
And but in society of a sovereignty we are not willing, you know. There, there is not like, you know there is no trade off. But in this those 2 kinds of society more modern, I mean, we are, you know there is like their Perks. There are advantages in giving up the information.
Yeah, I mean, Grace, you're I mean, if you, if you kind of zoom in very kind of close, yeah, you could make this argument that the credit card is not continuous, but the idea is that i'm being monitored all the time. I mean, I might not be using the credit card right now, but the the bank
is monitoring me at all the time. So if I use that any point in time, the bank will know, because it's it's being monitored, you know.
like even like it. But but you guys get a grier like rear like it. It's the same logic. I mean, yeah, I get you guys, if you come very close in your analysis you can say no more salad. This is continual.
However, the bank
there there there is people there are systems 24 by 7 at the bank monitoring what I'm doing with my card, even if my cards just my wallet right like
exactly joy. This is one of the differences. Okay, you're right, is one of them. That control is not in one particular institution. Control is just everywhere.
Yeah, the people I love your questions, your comments, you know.
Yeah. So I keep keep flowing. This i'm gonna keep pushing because we need to move, because I now i'm starting to get concerned. So look so. What we have is that kind of in in? Look at. Look at my slide here. Don't know if you can see my my cursor. But like in societies of control, you know what you have is that is the ultra ultra rapid forms of free floating control. So control is just like, you know, all the time kind of going.
So look the logic behind his argument. Look at the logic. So I mean just like it here, what he's doing. Because, look, I organize my slides in the same way that he organized his article, so I can explain the I to you, and then it's easier for you to read right. So so the logic is like. It's actually a section in the article. So here in the Under logic, what he does is what the Liz does is that he explains better how this whole thing works. So he says, Look in in societies, in disciplinary societies.
What we have is like. It's almost like we. Our information we like we are independent variables, and the whole point or the control itself.
is an independent, variable. It is sort of analogical. And then in a society of control it becomes a a modulation. Okay, so
so like like the the the the enclosures, like the the enclosures in a society like the institutions. If he's calling institutions, enclosures, so the institutions in a society of control, you know they are still distinct. They look distinct. We have the family, the school. But what we have is, you know there's this modulation within them. Okay.
So so think about even like, you know when we look back at society, think about how the workplace changed at people
before we used to have salaries or wages, and we still have salaries and wages. However, now we also have bonuses now, so it's like the idea of a bonus is almost like this modulation that you like. Once I tell you. You look there's a bonus for you like before was
you? Leave your house and you leave your family, and you go to work. Okay in the disciplinary society.
and then that's it. You finish work. You go back home, and that's it. Now, I tell you. Look, there is that bonus
I'm going to pay you some bonus, and then what do you do.
you now? Your. You take that work, that separation between family and work? It's gone. You know the very idea of upon us makes you kind of. You know that control
is in your hand all the time. So you go back home, and you're going to talk to your part. You're going to discuss something you said. No, I should some work now, because you know I wanna I want to get my bonus. Do you guys get what i'm saying? I'm just seeing the chat, because I know you guys are pumping like there. Let me see. So
yes, modulation, Jessica. Yes, I mean again, the here it's not very clear. Correct? Okay. You could, Jessica interpret modulation as an incentive.
Well.
I also as an incentive, but Not only, you know, modulation is the control, and the the incentive is a form of control as well. So you know, I know that you are looking for very clear cut answers, but you know it's it's like social science. So here there's a little bit of interpretation, but it can be interpreted in that way. Okay.
Yeah. So Grace, what I said was that, you know, like disciplinarian society's control was kind of analogical, you know, if you want to make a kind of he's doing like philosophy here. This guy's a philosopher actually. So he's using kind of funny words, so he's saying it's on a logical like old kind of telephones, not like the digital kind of telephone that we have now. So he's saying, One kind of control is on a logical and a lot of means. It's kind of binaries, 0, and one, you know. That kind of when we look at computing is a very kind of clear kind of obvious kind of
control that starts and stops starts in stock. That's what he meant. And then modulation is that kind of control that never stops so blurring the separation between exactly that Kathleen Surveillance surveillance
blurs that separation completely. And now that you guys are thinking, probably you're gonna say, yeah, I can see I can see. Look when I, when I have this credit card here with me when I have my credit card, you know, like
there is no separation between my house.
You know this is from Brazil. Actually this credit cards from Brazil, but I can use it anywhere. So there is no separation between my home Brazil, my country. Brazil, my country, Canada, my home in Canada, the bank, you know, the restaurant in Canada, the restaurant in Brazil. It doesn't matter, because I mean I can use it anywhere, and the bank is controlling me anywhere. Okay.
So let me just go back in here.
So let me just highlight some stuff in here so well that that those parts that I have on this slide for you is just like, you know, for you to kind of. When you go and read. You pay attention to that. So he talks about also training. Think about training. Training. Used to be something that belongs in this school system.
Only students used to do training in disciplinary societies. Now, training is something that you have to do your entire life. And again, and you do training at home. You do training at work, you do training in the school system. So I mean.
you know it's almost like, you know. Training is kind of evidence of this, this new form of control, and you have to do it. You know that I mean it's all almost like goes like self censorship you. You, you know that you gotta do that? Okay, for you to kind of, you know, do well in life
mostly important. Look. Ds: he means disciplinary society, so mostly imported here people in disciplinary societies. The power power controls individuals and messes so look
like we have a a form of power, you know. Let's say, a camera that can control the individual and can control many people together. This Isn't Disciplinary Science in societies of control. What we have is, it is a some sort of control that individuates you.
It is individualizing.
So it it it's almost like before, was one person versus many people.
Right so now we don't have that dichotomy anymore. Now, one person
and many people like it's almost like
I can. I am able now with the technology that is available to us. We are able to control many people, but in that individualizing way it can be like it could be the population of China. 1.4 billionpeople, and that's why i'm gonna give you some Chinese example. I mean you can. You can be work with us a huge population, and you can have controls in place that actually individualizes each and every person in that population of 1.4 billionpeople.
Okay. So
let's see here.
people. I'm just an advanced a little bit, and then I go. I go. I go back to the chat. Okay. So look.
if you want to think about the economy in disciplinary societies. The economy is about raw materials and machines. So we have.
we change, we transform raw materials, we trust like, and then we have machines, and in in parts are assembled, and then we have, like something like a a a product, a commodity. And when it comes to, you know when it but like now I mean it. It it's almost like oh, sorry, sorry people! Sorry I said something here in disciplinary societies. It's about raw materials being transformed so just like the economy kind of in the before 1980 S.
So in in in, in in societies of control, what we have is this idea of everything is go globalized, and then parts are are flowing from one country to another country, and they are being assembled. So what I said about the assembled is, it belongs in the society of control. Okay.
corporations think about corporations, corporations. They they they are everywhere, and they work as a orchestrated kind of entity, controlling everything
right. Think about Apple. Think about, you know, Walmart, think about those big corporations like the top 10 largest corporations in the world, which they have, like, you know, like a huge share of the world. Gdp: right? So just to think about the economy, because he talks a little bit about the economy. So and then he says, look
like there's a third part of the third and last part of his like article that he talks about the program. So he talks a little bit about the logic of how those 2 societies work disciplinary versus Society of Control. And then he talks about the program. So he's gonna see, he's gonna say look
like here. So it's almost like
like societies of control. They look like science fiction.
Is this idea that you are being cultural, that it looks like brave new world. So it it looks like, okay, everything is under control. Everything's clean, Everything is organized, I mean, and it's so funny, because perhaps now, with the pandemic
we we kind of. We have more kind of it. It's easier to visualize. It's almost like scientific. You can. You know we're all together here in this screen. I mean, you know I don't know if you guys are kind of understanding what i'm trying to convey. But it's it. It gets like you know, like control is everywhere, you know. You go, for you go out in the streets, and then, you know, and then
you move from one place to another place, and from one person to another person, and there's no barriers, I mean, you know there's no like, you know. It's all very fluid control became extremely fluid, and the pandemic kind of accelerated that. So let me just see here.
hold on! Let me just see the chat because I I wanna
Okay. So what is missing here?
I kind of I kind of.
I think, Valencia modulation, and I think an example of modulation. Yes, Valencia. Yes, you know you're you're correct. And see here, Jessica, Ds. Would would would be civilians because you don't want to.
No, no. There when he talks about raw materials. He talks about the economy itself, because I mean, he makes a link between surveillance and protection. Okay, because people think with me, I know that you guys are coming from both science and everything. But try to think from the business perspective. I mean, think about the amount of surveillance that goes in the workplace for
goods, commodities to be produced. Okay. So like the way that we produce things change it. Once surveillance changed the way that we produce things changes. So now we can produce things all over the world because we can. You know we are able to track. We are able to monitor before we couldn't do that. We didn't have that technology. Okay.
yes. And also there is this aspect of transforming us into into docile kind of compliant workers.
curfew and hours and get back.
Exactly it, Grace. This is a perfect example. Curfew and Quebec.
Okay among among Thank you for your question there. Very good. I's asking us about code and signature. Yes, in society of in society, of in, in in disciplinary societies.
e. We like, since we would have to sign everything was a signature.
you know, like we didn't have people. It's just because you guys are too young. But we didn't. We didn't have the idea of password. The idea that you need a password, a code, a password, is a code. The idea that you need a password, something very new, like when I was a kid. It was signatures everywhere, and then slowly became all about, you know, like even like the bank system before it was like checks. You would have to sign the check, and now you know, All of a sudden they came cards, and then there's a password so so like the the theers say, look in in disciplinary and societies. They have
signatures.
and and and now we have codes. It's almost like we. I'm no longer my signature. I am a code, you know that I type in for everything right? So it's almost like we humans we are. We are reduced to a number. Okay.
Yeah, okay. So we wouldn't be the wrong. No, but the exactly he's talking about the transformation. Yeah, it's exactly all the surveillance that is behind, you know, like the way that we produce things, including work, work, work, workplace, surveillance on workers, people. So far, so good. Or you you guys are thinking she's delusional.
Come on, everybody. I want to hear people who don't really talk a lot on the chat. So
are you guys following, or you are like? Oh, this is the delusion. I can't follow what she's trying to say.
Okay. So
okay, so look
just for us to wrap up here a little bit more information for you.
So, according to the loose in societies of control. We don't really have enclosures anymore. So, for example, he talked about enclosures, so he says the list says No, in the of controls.
It's not about enclosures. It's about continuance. So what we have is a bunch of continuums, things that they never and nothing ends. Okay, so and it's all like prison, and I really like this is at the end of the text. I really like some of those ideas here. He says that Look.
prison, do. The prison is a very old kind of idea.
It's almost like it's a very old kind of institution.
It's almost like we don't need reason anymore.
you know, like he's making philosophy people right. He's not saying like, Open up the gates. No, he's making philosophy, so he say, Look! Because we are under control all the time.
and you know.
and we now have electronic callers for prisoners. So potentially in the future, we're not going to have that institution anymore, like concrete, concretely speaking, you know. Because
why we're gonna keep people in jail, you know, and and pay so much money. I mean, each person costs about like $120,000 per year, you know, in Canada the Federal system, I mean. Why, you're gonna keep people in jail if there's there like digital ways to control someone and different ways to end. They unable someone
right like to disable someone like in the you know, like that. You kind of make that person you restrain, because reasons about restraining right like. So we we now have other ways to restrain people. So maybe in the future before I die before we die. We're gonna see, you know.
So prison chain school the same.
It's like, you know.
School changes that I mean. School used to be something. Now it's in big. I I see my students everybody. Everybody is kind of stressed.
It's almost like school became kind of a form of work.
So you guys are super young, but you are as stressed as any any worker, any employee, because it it. It never ends right like it never ends. You finish your bachelor's degree, and then you're not done. I am free. I'm! Finally out of prison, and then, all of a sudden you have to do your masters, your Phd. And then you have to do your your clinical degree, your whatever it's, never ending right like hospitals. You know, he says, that perhaps one day we're gonna have. We're gonna create some sort of hospital that has no doctors
or patience, and it's 20, because now we see that there is a huge movement for, like for digital kind of forms of medicine where you know it's all through the camera, you know. And so so what he wrote. He wrote this in the 90 S. It's almost like becoming a reality, right? So
i'll get you in it in a bit, Jessica. So people i'll get back to those questions that you guys have. Let me just move.
So how do we?
How do?
Oh.
It's my question. Here is my my my question is missing. I have to fix this slide.
But how do we here's missing, and we how do we resist?
Just a side of control, and that's my question for you. Where is the chat? Let's see.
Jessica. Go back to your question later. But tell me, how do we.
if you want to resist, because, like you know, in the disciplinary society, if you want to resist, you can make a strike.
If you want to resist in the workplace you can strike. If you want to resist you can. You know you can, you can. You can do something to the teacher you can ask. You can get the teacher, the teacher, the pro for, like you know, dismissed.
but, like you know, because the like, the teacher represents a form of control, you can dismiss that form of control. But how do you resist in a society of control?
Yes, Greer, exactly that. I mean. I see that loss of humanity, you know.
Yes, Jessica refused to participate. Maybe I mean, I'm kind of putting you guys to think, because this is a hard question. How do you? How do we resist. Because even what I want you guys to think actually is like the ways in which we resist is becoming sort of outdated.
You guys see that I mean the ways that we use to do like barricades, you know. You, you know, like you fire up some, you know, tires, and you do bar barricades that doesn't work anymore.
you know.
So
how do we do? Right? So
yeah, exactly, someone you're right like in some countries you can't. But like in those countries where you can. How do you do it, You know.
Yeah, being aware, prop knowledge, maybe you know.
Yeah, quite. I I jess that you're right, quite quiet, which became like something very like, you know, like walking away from your workplace. Yeah, maybe. How about how about school? So schools and other things? So, people, let me give you some more in in perfect example.
I told you that in a society of control.
you know, like it's almost like, you know control is, it individuates you so it, like surveillance, is able to capture you.
It's almost like all of us. We have an individual side, and we have a collective side.
We are individuals, but we belong to groups. Do you agree with me?
We're all individuals, but we belong to groups, school, church, hockey, game, whatever hockey, you know. Sports, I mean, we belong to groups. So I would like to give you here. Go back to that stuff that I studied in China called Household Register, which already gave you some. You know one of my lectures. I talked about that because I want to show you
how this household register controls you as an individual.
your individual side, and also your collective side.
So this is kind of a like, you know. People say, oh, this is like, not high tech. Yeah, but it it's extremely powerful. It is a form of control that now is high tech because it has been digitized. So look. I want to go back here to my lecture very quickly, so i'm gonna take you to China
is just to refresh you. And so you kind of see empirically know what I'm trying to say.
Look
again. This is an example of a surveillance mechanism in a society of control. Okay. So the type of society that they lose talks about. So look, this is like, Imagine this is a kind of family Id
imagine. Let's suppose that you guys you you have a family. So this is an Id for your family. He has your
type of household. It classifies, if you are from like Edmonton, Rural or Edmonton urban
it. It gives a house household number for you. It gives you your household address, and it collects data on your address on whoever is the household head usually might be, you know, if this is like China, it would be your father, you know, and lists all the household members, meaning your your siblings, and then for each member it has all those information.
Take a quick look. Just go over this list here very quick. Just go over the list.
Look, look at. Look, look at the amount of data.
Okay. So imagine. So. Each family has a little booklet, and you know, and that's it so. And now you think that
because this booklet
he has information of each household member.
and this booklet is managed by the Government, the Government is able to pinpoint
each and every person in that society that society in China, so like the government, is able to kind of literally pinpoint like this, is you in a very kind of individualizing way, but also the Government is able to see who your family is.
and people think. With me family is the one of the most important, if not the most important institution in society.
Okay, it's. It's the basis of society. Like it. It's where society starts. So so you know the Government is able to see you as a an individual being
and as a collective, like your individual side and your collective side
Is this clear?
Let me see if this is clear, because
oh, gosh, you guys are chatting there, I mean, not chatting like you. You have a lot of good com. It's just like too much for me to follow and and teach at the same time.
Yeah, we're okay, yeah, okay, Sarah, let me see if there is an actual
yeah, you guys are all right. What I see here. It's it's good stuff, you know.
Okay. So you guys, okay, so any questions so far. Are you following me. So you know.
Okay. So here, look, let me tell you how this starts in China. So in China
you are born in China, and then you know. That means that your parents they have to go to the police station. They have to register you, and that means that you're gonna have. If this is that booklet
you're gonna have. There will be a page for you. So there will be one extra page for you with all your information. Okay? And then when you turn 16, or even earlier, people apply for an Id for you like you're gonna have your own. Id just like in Canada, and then you know your photo is fed into that system. So the Government now has your Id number to and your photo. Okay, that is what that means. That like, Not okay. Now you are 16. You're gonna need to buy a a cell phone because that's what everyone
but it does, right. So you need a a cell phone, or even earlier before that. And then your parents for you to get that that that the the chip, like the telephone cheaper ship
like for you to get that ship you need you. You need to have your id. So you go to a place, you know, some like kioski on a shopping mall or some kiosk on on the streets, and then you ask for a telephone number, and then you buy your telephone number, and then the person who sells at you? They're gonna ask. Look! Can I have your Id please? And then you're gonna give
them your Id, and that means that they're gonna now tie your telephone number also goes inside of that data set. So now the Government has has this data set with all information about you, your family, and including your Id and your telephone number. Okay. So look.
And then that means what for you to go on the Internet.
You know, in China, I mean if I don't if you ever visit China, but for you to go on the Internet, in China, I mean, you need to have an a a a a, a a chip with a telephone number that was purchased in China. So if you're gonna use your your Canadian cell phone it doesn't work. So I won't Be surprised if people here tell me all I was in China like just connect connection for Thailand and you know I could not access the Wi-fi: yeah, because the wi-fi identifying that we have a foreigner number and won't allow you to go to on the Internet because they entered the all
like the entire control on the Internet side to your cell phone number, which is tied to your Id, which is t to your family people. It doesn't take it doesn't need to to be too much smart for you to understand that if you screw up and you say anything on the Internet that is kind of
complex or or like deviant, You know. You know the Government will know who you are, like they individualizing kind of power, and also who your family is.
and they're gonna be able to play that all don't do that because you have a family and you will do self self censorship, self surveillance because you're gonna say, i'm not gonna do this strip thing, because if I do this stupid thing on the Internet that's gonna compromise my entire family. Do you guys follow me. What I just try to, you know. Let me see on the chat again.
So one more thing in China for you to get any kind of act, any kind of email, any kind of
Internet thing. You need to have a telephone number. Why? Because that's exactly where
the control is. So you cannot sign up. We follow the number you cannot use. We chat. This is like not easy. It's just like a a gmail kind of you know. Let's look just like a free mail account. You know a ball, you know, just like the Twitter, I mean. You can't go, and you know. And again, so that kind of control, because we have
an individuating kind of control, individualizing kind of control plus a control that controls you in the collective. It makes you con continuously think about your individual self and your collective, the group where you belong, which is the family.
Okay, so let me see here.
So
okay, this is making. Yeah, it's. It is scary to something. Yeah, it is making sense. So far, okay, good. So this is
some things.
Yeah. So that is that that happens in China all the time. Okay? So why I'm give you the China example. Because I wanted to give you kind of an empirical example of what it looks like. You know this kind of continuous control. It's continuous people.
Okay, that this is actually it. I'm not it. This is not fiction, I mean, this is not a novel. Now this is actually a country right? So, and like they, co Covid.
it made that, even, you know, because now, like the government in China, for example, they are controlling Covid through your cell phone. So you know you like there, like the Government access.
let's suppose, like they see your your contact list, all the people that you have in your contact list
and the government tracks you like because they can see where you are. I mean, cell phone calls for that like the GPS, right? So they can see all you know. Valencia, Mant, Marcella and Marcella Head, Covid. How do they know, because everything is linked like even like your your hospital files, they are linked back to your, to your Id, which are linked back to your cell phone number so like, so the Government can tell. Okay, Valencia. She went for coffee yesterday with Marcella and then Marcella.
Today in the morning she got a diagnosis of Covid. Okay. So that is what the Government sends Valencia a message, Valencia. It's time for you to quarantine
quarantine, because you know, you met Marcella yesterday, and she had Covid and all. Therefore it means that you're gonna have Covid, you, you know. So it became like Covid in China. It took it to the next level. And probably now you guys understand, because in Canada there was a huge push against those health apps that were like, you know, tracking Covid cases, you know
so
so essentially what we have here in China is a surveillance assemblage. It's like, you know. We have the household Register, which is this thing that I introduced to you right? This it looks very innocent. But again, remember, this thing has been digitized.
so it looks very innocent, has been digitized. So we have the household register. Now you have cameras refer to fish intelligence. You have the phone number helping you have Internet access being monitoring. You have the Id that helps you. A photo provides a phone. So it's like this whole assemblage you have. This is just to give you a few examples. There is much more than that. Right? Look.
I would like you later. I would like you later to watch this video that I have for you here.
The link to the video is underneath this slide on the notes.
I you must watch Why? Because I will put a question about this video on the exam. So go and watch. If you watch the the the carefully. I just listen. Watch it's just like I don't know
couple of minutes like, you know
it is gonna show you. You know how this whole thing works, and it's gonna show you that you know the police in China, even if we're talking about a huge city with like 7 10 millionpeople. If you do something wrong, they are able to identify you, because again they have cameras everywhere. They zoom in
a camera with artificial intelligence. They get your face very quickly. They process your face. They know who you are. They know your family. They know your address. They know everything about you. They find you in a matter of seconds, like minutes minutes. So look at this video because you're gonna see that it takes like 7 min 7 min for the guy to be found, you know, like. So take a look at this
so obviously for this level of surveillance in a society of control to work. What we need is big data.
Do you guys see the connection surveillance big data. Now, I mean, you need huge computers with like
an astronomical capacity to process data.
And that's why China, us Japan, Germany. They are the the countries in the world that they are racing to create supercomputers. Why do they need super computers? Because, again, it's in this astronomical amount of data being processed right like, let me see the chat.
Let me see people. Well, you guys are
normal. Yeah, it gets all normalized, too much control. It gets normalized. Yes.
and and again, you know, I mean it. It gets convenient. Because, look, I, I want you to think about
for those of you who are like desperate. Oh, my gosh! This is too much control. This is awful.
There is always a flip side.
It makes your life very convenient, because you know, you know that Marcel had Covid. You know that you need to you. You watch yourself, you know. You know that you know, like the like in China during the Covid time, even to to this date people are able to know if they can go to the it's very easy for the government with this amount of data
to create a map.
a detailed map and tell the the population. Look those areas. Those are where we have Covid, so avoid, so it makes it makes easier for you. There is. There is a convenient kind of side.
You guys get what i'm trying to say. There is a cool so people it's almost like we are willing to give the data.
not everybody. But there's a lot of people saying, you know what I mean. It's actually for my safe it. Why not? Right? So
no North Korea, Kathleen. It's a little bit different. I would say that North Korea is still trapped in the in a very kind of
he hasn't changed much. I mean the type of control there he would be the we violent to us a societal sovereignty moving towards the disciplinary Society.
So it's kind of a mix of society, of sovereignty with disciplinary society. They are not here yet. Where China is.
you know.
Yeah. So this is very good. So people, so far, so good.
See how much time. You see.
I'm gonna take you now to Jeremy Bentham, because, look
I, we talked about Foucault already.
but I want to take you back to full call, because for quite a very important author.
and in the I mean
everything that the Lewis wrote about power and surveillance. I already told you. You got it from those slides here.
Okay, so you got it. I mean those lies. I mean, they're all here. That's it. He he never wrote too much about it. Unfortunately, I wish that this guy had to written more about surveillance.
Okay, so now we're gonna now that you understood what the Liz said about society of control. I'm going to take you to Foucault Marcel. Why, you're going to go back to focal in the kind of go deeper now, because he's a very important to offer for surveillance studies.
And some of you, if you ever decide to do a. You know, in both science or sociologic terminology. If you' to kind of study surveillance, you're going to need this guy. Okay. But before we talk about
so cool, I would like to talk about this other guy here called
Jeremy. He was a Scottish guy. Okay, British Scottish. And this guy here. He was traveling in Russia.
Okay, he was traveling Russia.
and he saw a building
that
someone introduced him to a building.
and and he had access to the blueprint of a building.
and he found this building. Extraordinary!
Why? Extraordinary? Because it was a kind of.
I think, that allowed for total surveillance, for, like complete surveillance.
so surveillance like it, you would. It. It was a kind of building that could serve. You know, the purpose of punishing people. It could be just guarding people watching people like you know, like you could work as it could work as a prison. It could work as a school where the teacher needs to see everybody equal to work as a workplace where you know, one big boss can see everybody working it could work it. It was like, in his opinion, his mind was a a fantastic.
multi-purpose building that would allow for any kind of life.
and like like any kind of any aspect of life you know Prisons hospital school, and in in he named
that that prison, that that building, Panopticon, or Inspection house.
he actually, when he was to traveling.
he wrote a letter, a bunch of letters about this building.
and and he sent those letters back to the Uk. And those letters became a book. They are compiled in the book today. That which is called Panoptican, or Inspection House. So a lot of the ideas behind surveillance, not only from the Liz, but also from Foucault.
He came from reading from them, reading that book. You know it's a collection of ladder. If you're curious, I mean, you can Google that you're gonna find the Pdf. If you want to see the actual booked. Our library, the of has it. Okay? So let me just see.
Yes, exactly, Selena, the panopticon. So look, this is the building, you know this is kind of an interpretation of the the this, this, this drawing was not by journey. This is an interpretation, but that would be the beauty. Imagine
this could work as a factory. It could work as a hospital; it could work as a school; it could work as a a prison. It could work as any kind of in any kind of situation where you need someone watching everybody. Right so.
and look, think of. Think about the economy of it. The economy of it. One person watching, let's say, 300 people.
So it's very economical.
Do you guys do do you see that? What i'm trying to say here, very economical. So surveillance has to do with the economy
because you save you save money, save, you know, like you save right. So by just having one person watching many.
So
this was actually the blueprint that you're gonna find. If you go fetch the book, the actual book that's that's what it looked like, okay and and okay. So so you so you know that that's all you need to know from Jeremy.
So he was the source of inspiration for full call for the news and for all the surveillance scholars. Okay.
So now, people we're gonna talk about. So let me just see if you have questions, or if there is anything that I that I need to address that I did not.
Yeah, actually. Yes, Elena, I later, when you were studying later, read this thing here. Okay, Read this part the slide. Okay, I'm not going to read for you just to save time. But read that. That's where you're going to find that his explanation
People, Are we good?
Can we continue
what a spot might be a bad thing for? Yeah. Would you mean a spotlight like when there is like a hidden kind of space. Yes.
but in this building joy there is no hidden. I mean, you can see everywhere like right like.
Oh, you mean like a spotlight like you. I didn't get your question, Joy. Explain to me what you mean. I did not get your question.
No, not the dates? No.
yeah, like joy. That that picture, this picture here is kind of
this is kind of a you know. Now that you're bringing this up. I'm not going to use that again ever in my course, because I mean, this is just like the actual pump optical that doesn't have that spotlight. Okay, I mean, this is just like a I our re interpretation. But the you know, actually, Joy, Thank you for bringing that up.
I'm not gonna ever use this picture again, because, look, the idea at the very idea of the panopticon is that you don't need a spotlight.
because I mean there's no need for that.
It's just like it. That's that's the beauty of this building. You don't need anything. I mean, it works again. Goes back to you guys later. You read, please. You read that, you know that's the you. You gotta read my slide. So you read this slide here because you're gonna it's beautiful, I mean, beautiful, like in terms of effective. It's extremely effective.
But thank you for bringing that up.
So let's see
if there is anything else. Make sense. Right? Okay, Good.
Okay, people. So let's talk about full call. Let me just pull my order. I have another ppt for you. Okay. So let me just stop sharing this one here.
I'm gonna get the order ppt that we have for today.
Okay. So
where is the meeting?
Oh.
you guys is up here? Okay, here.
Exactly, Lucy, Lucy. Wonderful comment. You're You're very right, you know. You're very right. So I love. I love that you guys brought this up. I mean, Thank you, Joy and all you cause that. Now it's actually making you think. Okay, yeah, yeah, that doesn't make sense. I'm gonna you know
that i'll never use that that I got that from the Internet. Just so you kind of, because sometimes it's hard to understand the blueprint.
But that fire back, you know. But that's weird in the hand was good.
So you see me right like you see, my
hey, people, let's go back. So look, i'm out like Foucault. Okay. So look.
people have just like like a phone call.
So now again, be aware, make make a note for you. You are going back to full call, and Foucault is.
we're talking about the disciplinary societies, our Society of Discipline. However, you want to call it like we're talking about discipline. Okay, we're not talking about the science of control that do lose. We're going to go back to into a little bit of a deep dive. Is that okay? Are you guys on the same spot with me. We are going back to full call just to do a big kind of a deep dive. Okay, just be be be careful here, so full call
for him to theorize power like I I I would like to tell you where his ideas came from
so focal. What he did was he was, he liked to do archive or search a lot. So he was. He always did a lot of archival research in Paris, in the museums in Paris. So he start to kind of compare this situation of a plague. Do you guys know what a plague is?
What is the plague people.
Blake, what is that word?
I want people plague like like Covid Covid became a plague.
Okay.
yes, it is some sort. Yes, exactly exactly. So it's some sort of like, you know, mass, sickness, illness. You know this disease that spreads.
And he compared the situation of okay. So let's talk about play first. So what do you do in a situation of playing? So
you know, according to his research archival research, what you do is you do strict spatial parting.
Okay, so it's like, you know. You kind of you you like when you go read like the the like, the chapter by full call. You're gonna see that in the beginning it scribes what we do.
So we we close everybody just like what we did with Covid. We close, we organize everybody we divide. People say, okay, you don't have Covid. You have let's organize society people who have Covid. You're going to say you're going to stay there. People who don't have. Covid, You're going to stay here. You're going to classify people. You're going to give them a green tag, I mean, if they are green they don't have, Covid. They're green. They have a green code just like they did in China. If you have Covid or red, that means that you have to quarantine you water. You sort.
you pro heaped you tell you, you people who have Covid. They cannot leave the house, you know, and you do. You do surveill you surveillance. They do surveillance surveillance on them. You
you make them stand still. It's about immobility just like we were. We were immobile like, right so and you punish people.
you know you punish the people who they don't comply. You punish them Obviously, in today's world you don't. We don't punish with death.
but you know, in it, like back in the days in the archives when you know, like you like Foucault Michelle for was doing research, you know, in France medieval times. If someone had like, you know, some sort of plague
like, you know, like you, you were like trans meeting that to someone. You could be killed right like for for doing that. So another thing that you do.
You do inspection
like like you, don't you never stop. Look at this word here. This is. See Sellessly, I mean you. You never cease to do inspections. So you are constantly monitoring watching. You know you. You create militia to help you watch
in China. I don't know if you guys heard that. But like people in China, they actually create some sort of it. It was kind of a a sort of militia neighborhood militia. So the the the people in that leash, and they would go around making sure that there was nobody in the streets, you know, you know, like that kind of stuff mean china. We had a little bit of that, too, because I mean you could get fined, you know, if you were out on the streets and get back. I remember people complaining a lot even here in that Newton, you know. And so you, you know you do create check
checkpoints in China.
in in Chinese seed is the way that people kind of the buildings. They are always in the kind of courtyard there is like a courtyard. There is a building, and there's another court er the building. What they did in China, for example, they get checkpoints for it to go in and out. You had to kind of show that you didn't have Covid. So you know. So it's all about visibility, you know, in full course, text. He's scribes that people, you know, like back in France they would be displayed like the government. Would, you know, Just ask people to just be displayed.
you know, in the window, so you know, like everybody would come to the you know the house window so the Government could see them and see if they didn't have symptoms. So you have to obey the authority, you know you have to. You know what it like, you know, like any kind of like disorder, any kind of extortion, any kind of theft, any kind of disorder would be punished.
Is this clear? So that's how we kind of you know
we deal with a situation of playing. I think that's kind of easy for you, because we just survived a plague right like. So we are kind of coming out of that. So it's sort of what happened to us.
And then.
So here's like, you know what i'm giving to you in those 2 lines is like it's. It's the idea, the big idea like the summary for you. Why do I have those drawings just to make you kind of like cute words
in a plague. What you do is you govern life and death. That's why I have a baby, and I have this this thing here symbolizing death. So enough situation of plague, according to full calls, like article in all chapter. You govern life and death.
So what he's trying to say he do Here, people he's trying to conceptualize. Take note of that. He's trying to with this idea of plague. Fu call is trying to conceptualize what
disciplinarian societies or disciplinary societies. Is that clear?
So he's trying to conceptualize Marcel. How about those other 2 drawings?
This is like a
cashier where you record? I put that in here just to kind of make you remember your word record because you record everything. You organize everything, everything you know. There, there are records being produced, and here, you know the same.
you know, like the the like. It's just kind of make you our just to make you remember like recording the idea of like records being produced. Think about the pandemic. If you're going to have a restaurant like the restaurant would want your, you know your I've like.
So I think. Let's see, because I can't even remember any more. I was like your name, and your contact information. Is that correct.
like even here in Canada, like I remember me going to, you know, Torinko, or you know, next to act. And people would ask, you know. Oh, yeah, your vaccine status wonderful? Yeah, You guys got it right? So so for you for us now, all kind of looks obvious. But again now, because we just survive the plague and what you know.
so that makes it's making more sense. So here those are the excerpts that you know that I want you to kind of pay attention to them. I mean when you are reading. But i'm not going to read them for you, because just for the sake of time.
So i'm August. So he
when i'm on. So when for call
talked about the plague, and that's you know the the bulk of the chapter is discussing how we manage a plague. What he, fu call, was trying to conceptualize what he called
disciplinary society. Okay.
you get it there.
Exactly.
Thank you. Grace.
So, people, if you're not following, just let me know, because I can repeat. And I want you to follow exactly that. Okay, so look. And why do those features that I have here is just like a little summary for you the idea that power this is like a power kind of thing. As I put here. So you remember, power power is almost like it's continuous.
right? So it's like, you know. It's it's it's a it's. Look! And you're gonna tell them bomber cell this does not match with what you just said
like
right. I mean if you have a good memory, and if you work, pay attention to what I just said when I was talking about this, and I was talking about how to lose, interpreted Foucault. You're gonna No, no, but for the lose like Power became continuous Later in his society in the Society of of control.
not in this disciplinary society.
Am I right? Did you guys understand what i'm saying?
Did you guys get that contradiction.
I want people. I need you to to be on board with this. What I'm trying to say to you here is okay. You You got it. Okay? Why? Because again, that text was the this interpretation of full call.
Now you're actually listening to full call and for call. He he talks about like, you know.
power being continuous, but he did not kind of delve too much on that. But even like he was sale, Power is like more continuous, you know. But but you know he was also saying that to us continual. So you know, Co. Wrote a lot.
and it's like in even like this chapter is a long chapter. So sometimes he, you know, he's not like super super accurate. Okay. So just be mindful of that.
Okay. So. But don't you worry because in the exam i'm not going to create traps around that. No, because that would be too crazy like 2.
But so, anyway. So look so. Here's full call, like another part, just full call. Kind of trying to explain. You know. The power, you know, becomes continuous, you know. Sometimes he goes back to the idea of enclosure again, you know. So it's not very, very super clear. He's trying to create
a type of power he's trying to, you know, create the topology for power. So
another here for you.
So this is just to summarize those 2 slides here in key phrases for you. So remember, you know, disciplinarians in a disciplinary society like Bifurc.
Remember management of my from death.
Remember data collection.
you know, like here, like like like information being recorded right so in. If you read, you're gonna see that in a situation of plague like according to full call in the chapter he talks about like, you know, people's demographic being collected, you know all sorts of information being collected right so, and then a situation of confinement, you know.
That was according to focal. But look, this is me telling you today. We don't really need confinement anymore. I mean, we had confinement in the Covid.
but it's almost like it. We are able to control without co confinement. Okay, but again, but you could say otherwise. You would say, No, no. We still need confinement, because people don't obey right, and not everybody will base the the orders, but anyways power continuous, you know, according to full call.
If that'sparity in mind, I mean, keep like that, you know, for the his interpretation of for a little bit you from the natural focal.
and the environment becomes a disciplinary mechanism. So that's the idea. The whole environment
is built in a way that it forces you like a pre a playground like, you know. The camera like it forces you. Okay.
So so that's why he calls like it. Doesn't it doesn't really queue anybody, but it disciplines you so if you don't have your Covid pass, you cannot enter. If you don't have. If you don't want to give your Covid information.
you're not gonna be able to sit and eat at the ringco in Edmonton, right? So it it is an environment that forces you in the end. You might even say i'm not gonna take the vaccine. I'm against the vaccine, or I'm afraid the vaccine or whatever. But in the end you even comply because
it's like that environment. If you don't have the vaccine, it makes your life miserable. You guys get what i'm saying. Probably you heard, I mean I heard friends say, oh, you know I don't agree with that vaccine, and I don't like the vaccine, or i'm afraid of the vaccine, but i'm in the end all of them. They took it because
it was almost like unbearable, because if you don't have the vaccine. You can't try, and we can't. You can't, can't, you know You cannot do anything right? So
No, Joey, the environment is but for everyone, and that's Why, people, even people who didn't take the vaccine in the end in my example. Here they ended up taking it, because it makes your life a nightmare. If you don't have it
So that's the idea. The idea! Jo is the opposite of what you you know. So I mean I I just want to make sure that you understand that I mean it is an environment that you forces you to apply. And even if you kind of you know, you want to not comply.
You comply in the end, I mean, of course, we still have lots of people that say, oh, i'm not gonna just to use the Covid Fax, in example, a lot of people, said I'm not gonna take it. And I actually know a few people who never took it
but but their lives, I mean.
Oh, gosh, it's just like
It's just almost like unbearable, because you know, and not to mention the social criticism that they get right. So it's like it's just like it becomes unbearable.
Okay, so far, so good people.
So look
what is the what is like now that we like kind of understood what he's saying, what would be the strategy to combat the plague.
So 2 things, and he says that in the text number one order
order to fight confusion and fear.
So those are the things that you do.
You create some sort of all, all the present and ominous and ordering like this kind of power that is everywhere that can see everybody that is continuous.
Oh, we're so like, but like continues like Julie again, what that was the loose interpreting Here's who quote telling you
so. It lays out people's place. It tells you where you should go, and where you cannot go, where you know it tells you almost like who you are.
outlines your body, I mean Marcella outlines body. Yes.
because top of your body goes to your body, tells you. You know it. It goes. Really. I don't know if you guys feel that with Covid. But it was really about the body. It's almost like you cannot sneeze anymore. You can't coffee anymore. Now, I after Covid I became afraid of people cough and sneeze, and it's like, you know, I became this paranoid person, and even me and I can on the airplane when i'm coffee and sneezing. I'm ashamed. I don't know if you guys feel the same way, but it like it controls my body almost, you know, like it's almost like in voluntary.
you know, like I like kind of a sneeze, and I go. Oh, my! I'm so sorry like you know. I mean, why do you have to you? You're a human or sneezing, you know, like, but it changes you and outlines your body, and and and even like outline, in a way that if i'm sneezing, I put my you know I do that, and then like it, it is outlining by by, you know
it gives visibility to death in life. It becomes life. It makes, you know. You know, people who are dying You you're we are counting like you think about all the Government information that it was being F that you was about like. You know how many people are dying every day, and and how many people are becoming cured every day. So it's like, you know, information about life and death, and that's why you know, we talked earlier that you know, in a disciplinary society there is this management of life right? Like you don't kill people. You just manage their life
from Guinea toand
It defines what is true and what was. It is not true, you know. Think about the core of it, I mean.
you know, like people find No, this is true. This is not true in the government. Say, this is true. You know
it creates multiple separators or separations for people. So you know we become kind of every everything's organized.
and it designs individualizing distributions like.
you know. It's almost like, you know. I distribute to. I i'm gonna distribute you guys. I'm gonna sort, you guys, you know, individualizing away. I'm gonna say, okay, you are sneezing. You go there, your coffee. You go here, you have fever. You go there you have nothing. You go over over there. You you know you in a very individualizing way.
Okay, so let's see. I still have a couple of minutes. I'm going to use it. So look now, I'm gonna tell you guys something else.
So he
imagine for call sitting in the archives, analyzing how we manage plague in the seventeenth, eighteenth century, and he writing, trying to kind of make sense of surveillance of power. Right so.
And then he starts to compare. He starts to compare the idea of plague and leper. What is leper People
people leper quick here in the chat. Do you know what i'm talking about? Leper.
Is it? Is that illness as well? Yeah, leprosy, Exactly. It's leprosy. Okay, Exactly.
Now let me take you. I'm gonna take you. I know that we're probably I mean, you know, i'm sure that even if you are not from your religion background, your family, religious background is not Christianity.
I'm sure that you do have some knowledge of the Bible, because I mean it's it's it's bigger than us right. It it is a society so in think about the Bible or the the knowledge that you have it can be a lot of knowledge or limited knowledge.
What do people do with those who had lepers back in the days in the Bible
people back. We don't have a lot of time come to the chat.
Think about your knowledge vanished. What else?
Exile? What else? People. You're right. That's exactly that you exclude. You banish because I don't touch them. You stay away from them right? So, for call you start to think about compared comparing the idea of a plague and the idea of a le of leper.
because, like what we do is
with people who have leprosy, we like, not any more. But I mean, this is he's like building on historical facts, so he can do theory about power and surveillance. So he was like, okay.
you know it's different. I mean the plague. You don't exclude anybody.
You don't put, put people away. What you do is you sort. You You divide, you classify, you organize, you manage.
but with leprosy you don't do none of that. You just exclude.
so like you know, like you, you, you know you send people to some valley I mean talking about the Bible. You know. You send people to the valley some sort of valley, and then they all live there, and everybody has, and they die together. They live together, I mean nobody cares about them. Everybody stays away from them, and they have no contact with society. There's no management. There is just simply exclusion.
So look so, Foucault. It starts to kind of make a comparison. Here, Leper, exclusion, rejection, separation, exclusion, from power dynamics.
You take that person completely away from power dynamics, and they develop communities
ironically. Right? So that's the irony of it. I mean, you exclude. And then they create communities, and we've played. What you do is you subdivide. You distribute them, you know, like
you, you you you know you. You organize them in a way that you know even create identity, allows for them to develop into new forms of identity. You, I then look instead of exclusion them from power dynamics, You
you intensify
power dynamics. You intensify power over them. So if you go read the chapter, you're gonna see that when you know full code scribes that, but it the plague. And if you got my lecture it's much more control.
You know it's what which more power over those people.
But you know with later. You know. You just send them away.
you know. So here they develop communities, and here in the plague they develop a disciplinary society.
So if I did a good job. I'm not sure if I did.
You are able now to kind of see
the formation of that disciplinary society
kind of building on the idea of like so Foucault used. Take note of that. Foucault used
some sort of plague in society
to develop the concept of disciplinary society.
Is this clear people?
Let me see if this because this is this, is going to be on the exam. You need to know that the concept of Disciplinary Society came from, where Leper? No leprosy, no plague.
hey? Good.
So later You're going to read the stuff that I've left for you. Here, let me just see how much time I have with 2 min I don't have more time. So just wrap up here. Look actually for those important science. Come on, people in both science people call science. We are talking about 2 types of governance. The leper is a type of governance that could
cut cut off.
You know people from it, cut it cuts people off from all sorts of human contacts human contact.
It is a project. It is a governess
that has a project of exclusion. So, Lot Leper.
What kind of governance is this exclusion?
And how about Blake? What kind of governess is this? It is a governance of life and death
that you you control every aspect of society. It is the the type of governance that we kind of have today, even though we are moving to the science of control.
Keep it even the size of control. Who is to govern life? Right? So
so look it's not. It looks like a perfectly governed kind of city. That's what he says. This is his words. Actually okay, so
are those 2 types of governance compatible? Yes, they are
now, and Sometimes they come together. We're gonna talk about that, you know, because in today's society quite often, we use surveillance to exclude people.
So those 2 types of society. They come together. Okay, so, people, we didn't have time to talk about privacy. But it's okay. We're gonna do it next next week next to Thursday. So let me just see here, so that's it for today.
So let me know. I mean, you know, if you have any question, anything, you stay on the chat, please. I have off hours, too, and i'd like to issue a thing i'd like to thank you for your attention. I hope that all of them made sense to you. If not, please stay in the chat
and and thank you very, very much for attending class. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate your comments on the chat. Really, really, you know, Thank you very much.
You guys take care of
stay safe people, exercise. Take care of your mental health and physical health.
Any question. Just stay on the chat.
If you're waiting for off hours. I'm gonna as soon as everybody's going, i'm gonna open off hours. Thank you very much. People think all of you. I see your names here. Thank you very much.
You guys take care.
Hey, Nicole.
are you there?
Oh, sorry, no, I'm.
I oh, i'm good. I'm.
There you you
Thank you. You take care.
Hey, Valencia, Are you gonna move to office hours? I'm gonna open up right now for you. If you want you want to move there.
Sure.
well answer. Did that make sense to you? Let me just stop a recording hold on a second. I'm just.

<h1>Jan 26</h1>
  <p>
"Hey, folks! Welcome aboard! Welcome back! Hello, everybody!
I'm sorry I'm a little bit like slightly late late. I mean comparison to every day.
It's not even a minute. But like I had some issues with my zoom here. I don't know I had to restart my computer.
So how is everybody today.
We don't have a lot of people today, I think
just 21 people.
Okay, okay, everybody's doing well.
Okay. So first a heads up for you. If you go to E class.
you're gonna see there that like last week
after class I up or earlier this week after class, I updated one slide. So if you see this slide for last class, if you go on the class, I I am just checking or not to make sure that it is. Yeah. So if you go under theorizing surveillance one.
and if you see, like last lecture
you, you're gonna see that there is no less no sorry. The the lecture for the
for the nineteenth.
You're gonna see that there is a slide that has been revised. Okay, Slide Number 7. I'm: Just
yeah, that's it. So I just took like, you know, like there was like somewhere there. It was written disciplinary societies, institutions.
and then just cross that. You're gonna see Red, because I I kind of I kept I
changes so you could see, you know, just like just to make sure that you know. So whenever there is a need for me to
revised the slide to. Sometimes it's something wrong or something that's missing, or whatever i'll let you know, just like I did this time like you're gonna see on the class, you know, like oh, you know, revise that like, you know, check slide, whatever. Okay? And then you're gonna You're gonna open up and you're gonna see it. So if you have any concern
just going there and check it as i'm starting. And then you can ask your question. Okay. But do you have any questions so far? Are you guys doing well? I mean, are you? Is it making sense? I mean, are you learning something, because that's my concern. If you're learning something.
Come on, folks. Where are you guys? So are you checking these slides or your
okay? You're learning okay, good. Someone is learning. Okay, okay, good. So people you need to tell me, because again, the purpose is I what you guys should learn. But more than just learn. I want you guys to get your own brains kind of going.
so you know you can kind of start to think about surveillance for yourself and by yourself. I would like my dream here if I do a job, because, like this topic is going to stick to your mind forever, I mean, which is a little bit depressing. But you're going to learn a lot. Okay, and you're going to start kind of
Oh, look at this. She never said this. But now you're gonna create your own knowledge. Okay. So okay. So yeah, Joey, that's the purpose. I mean, it's a class of supposedly. If I do a job. You should be talking about it outside. Okay, so let me. Just. We're going to just finish off what I mean. We just have a couple of lines from my squad to finish.
I am going to share with you right now. I'm sharing.
Let me just make this bigger.
Oh.
it's coming. I think I would just duplicate this.
Okay. So now you should be able to see me and this lines. So if you, if that's not the case, please let me know. Okay. So let's just go to the end all the way to the end. So look, we talked a lot last class about
the plague which Michelle Fu call the French philosopher use to theorize disciplinary societies or societies of discipline or disciplinary society. However, you want to phrase it in English, he phrased. I mean the translation is disciplinary societies.
But again, this is like it comes from French. So you know there's some space for you know, accommodation here. So
so we talked a lot about, you know the like, the the the difference between the plague and and leprosy.
And we and I finish off last class, saying that essentially what we have here like after analyzed archival materials is that we have 2 types of governance, and I remember me rushing
to try to get those slides here for you, but like but that was the point. So leper is a type of governance. I mean in this text that that signifies a project of exclusion. You exclude people. You don't care about them. You are Ill out.
It's almost like you put a cross. You cancel them out.
Okay, so it's actually worse than cancelling, because it's almost like it's You're out of society
and Blake is the opposite. You don't exclude anybody. Everybody is in it is a social project which is, by the way, is very democratic.
Where the people with both science, it's very democratic. Okay. So like the the the leper project is not because it's you. You exclude people, but the plague from the Political science. Perspective is a democracy because
there is a space for everyone. It is just like in brave New World. There is a space for everybody, but some people will be Alpha. Some people will be better. Some people will be epsilon. So you know so
and so it's like like essentially what Foucault says is like like the plague.
It. It it looks like it looks like a society that is perfectly governed.
Okay, so everything is accounted for. Let me just take a look at the chat to see what what's going on here.
Yeah, Well, that I love this Jessica Jessica put it very nice people, I mean, yeah, it's it's not cancelling. It's Billy Team
and and that delete that is forever. I mean, you know you take it from your trash, can, too. I mean it's out right. So I I like this analogy. It's nice one.
Thank you.
Okay. So here I that's pretty much actually where I where I stopped. And this is my question for you.
Can those 2 types of societies or governance be reconciled? Are they compatible?
And the answer is, Yes, they are.
Think about surveillance people
and think about monitoring, pick up, think about data, collection everything that surveillance in there.
It can be extremely unfair.
He can. If there is a point to scheme, Caller. I am a I live witness of that because every time that I go through you know the airport, you know, I get pulled out, and I have to, you know, like, and then I see people that are not, and it's so funny because I have to share this with you.
I told you guys, that I spent last year in France right like I told you that. So let me share with you my first actually like this the first image that I had of Paris. So I flew in.
and then I I passed through integration.
But when I was queuing up in immigration, the first thing that I noticed was
and i'm not kidding was that, like like the darker you were in color.
the more kind of not abuse. I don't want to say a views, but, like the more rude the officer. The immigration officer would be with you.
So I was there waiting and watching, obviously coming from surveillance. I watched those things, and I could see like I saw. I remember seeing a woman and kids, and she was a a black, very dark skin.
and and like in it immediately. I could even hear, like the tone of what I mean. I was a little bit far away in the queue, but I could hear, you know, like imagine, I mean, I could hear the officer
talking to her, and kind of, you know, very kind of suspicious like it, like you have something to hide. Who are those children? What? What do you? What? What you're gonna do here in France, and and what's so funny because after
anyways, we kind of went, I mean, she went through, and then I came right after I went through, and then we went to there is like after right after you, you. You passed through the integration you have to collect your baggage, and then you put your baggage, your luggage through an X-ray
and and and then I love watching those things like whenever there is an X-ray, and people are kind of being selected. I was like, okay, let me watch this.
And indeed, the the same woman that was kind of being kind of not treaty, being not being treated with the same politeness that I I was, for example, some other people, or she would. She had to go through the the X-ray, and I did not.
You know, and when many, all the the people that I saw you know like nobody else went through. She was the only one pulled aside. So
anyways, I mean. So i'm just saying this because if you start to actually pay attention.
you're gonna see that surveillance can get very unfair, and we talked about that before in the course, and there is also a flip side, because your events also can produce fairness so like you. One of our articles, the readings that we had. It talks about what I mean in the past. Not today's class, but in the past. It talks about like a
how a woman talks about credits for like just a quick example, the text it talks about like how you know, like, because there's no algorithms and surveillance like doing people's credit scores like, you know, like black folks in the United States.
They, I mean they are not there. There is, there is no longer as much prejudice and discrimination against them as he used to be when there was a clerk, you know, like you know, an employee, a bank employee doing those credit scores, so you can go both ways. But we do see that surveillance is getting very unfair, you know. So surveillance has with the body, you know, so like the type of body that you have. It could be like, you know. I'll give you another example. Women who are pregnant
like until very recent like. If you were a pregnant women you would be seen by airport security almost as like. Oh, you know you're not a threat.
but then like in precisely because that was in case smugglers and and and you know, and like people dealing with drugs, they start to kind of pick up like meals, like transporters for pregnant women. The same is true for older folks like you older people.
They were never seen as a fat until now they became like, you know, one new, like the people who to support the drug. And now you know so so the has to be. If your body has to your social income, your income, your social class. Right so.
But anyway, so the point here is that I mean those 2 projects. They're being there, you know. They are kind of coming together. So it's possible that we have. You know, those 2 types of situations Our governance in one single society. Is this clear? So far, people?
I want to see some. Yes, and that's just my strategy to make sure you guys are alive, and you're not like
dying behind the screen, tired and annoyed, or something. Okay, people stay staying there. Go get some coffee or something.
So Val answer here. Would Would it be safer to say that it would be like it will send you. Yeah, kind of yeah, it would be, you know, but not not even like a: yeah, it would be more. Yeah, yeah, it is safer to say that in place like more, if you want to make it this kind of typology that's possible, but even people it's just because you guys did not read the whole book
in both societies in both societies Brave New World in and 1984. You do have a a a sub society.
or like a a place
that territory that is kind of you know, where you dump
like the people. Okay, dump. We've both okay. So you dumped people in there to people that you were excluding. So
i'm. See here some more. Matthew: this is right. Okay.
artificial intelligence software called Amazon. Okay, we recognition with Police Department United States.
This is Pax on the side?
Exactly.
Yes, I'm just going to finish reading into here.
Yes, exactly. You're very right. Okay, you. So you see, bias
being carried inside of the the algorithm in a very structural way, right like.
So let's see Joy here.
Yes, beautiful work.
So, Joy, you still. Yeah, you guys are doing, you guys rock and roll. Look, yes, and joy. Here comes with another an additional comment.
adding to Maths example: Yes, you're right. So surveillance can exclude and include at the same time
and survey. Yeah, this is beautiful. That's it. I mean, perhaps you could even finish the course. You know you got it. Okay.
So very good. So people look at this. This is what full process. Okay, so that you know that the cause Again Foucault went, and he read the Panopticon right by Betham or the Inspection House, because it has 2 names.
And he said that you know the panopticon is the architectural figure of the plague and the leper combined.
Okay. And here, let's just have a look look at this I would like to kind of go over those points where they're important. So the watcher in the Panopticon, the person who is doing the surveillance enjoys
full visibility.
so you it's almost like
the visibility, like you know, the the the space show, like the the geography of it.
is reorganized to facilitate visibility. So when we think about that, our that our architecture, I mean the whole geography is meant to facilitate visibility.
and and that is the case when we think about the CD. I haven't really walked around, and anything yet since I arrived from Brazil. But I can give you some examples from Brazil.
Brazil's a very violent country. So we do have, like a lot of the cities, the mayors. They create those architectures that they are very spooky like, and then people don't really have way to kind of shelter in there, or staying there, which is by way legal, resume it.
Mayors these 2 do that so they all. They put some like, you know, like things that are spooky, and and then, you know, nobody can, or so usually they do that under bridges. They do that under, you know, under some sort of space where people would be able to shelter.
And and one of the things that they argue is that I mean, though, that kind of architecture.
It generates visibility because it expels the people out so it makes them visible. It's almost like they. You know they they that that kind of architecture exposes the person that's that's what it is, and that's what they come optical that that does. I'm sure that in that meant that we do have, just because I'm i'm not fresh with the city because I I was a year old. But perhaps you guys can think of something
that you know there's some sort of architecture that is, it's made in order to kind of give the core visibility the the you know. I mean, i'm going to use. I'm gonna sociology here and use the deviant categories, the poor.
the the drug addict, you know, like the those who are excluded right like. It gives them visibility, and it exposes them.
So i'll. I'll check the check because perhaps you guys came up with something. But look! Surveillance subjects are individualized into an optic. I get Ming sales, and I can see each and every one of those. So it's very individualizing right like.
And
he says that the surveillance that the with an opticon a reverses the principle of the dungeon, which is like the cave, the the dark right. So, by doing what like usually like caves. They are enclosed. They are deprived of light, and they are at least to hide the panoptical.
It undoes that. So it actually you know, the only thing that is space in terms of like. If you want to compare it up an optic, and the engine is the enclosure, Everything else it's about light. It's about visibility. So surveillance people. When you think surveillance, you have to think about this, they call me
dark and light, hide and expose visibility.
and you know you have to think about that, because that's what surveillance does. Surveillance can be used to. You have to hide something
it can be used to, you know, to show something, but ultimately
like what? What makes it so powerful like that? It is it's ability to sh to cast light. Okay, I'll. I'll check the check in a second. So
So look at this. I really like this part. Actually the full lighting lightning in the eye of the supervisor capture better than darkness, which is outwardly protected.
So visibility becomes a track independent, and in surveillance is like that. So you have to be very careful with what you'd scroll and what you don't dispose right. Let me just see the check before we go.
We have plenty of anti- homeless. Exactly.
Yeah.
exactly. So it's definitely so
if you can think of anything specific and great, I mean, because yeah, there are many just to just to share, I actually I've seen those spooky things in a meeting that you know, like in downtown
Jessica Park benches. Oh, yeah, this is a very good one. Yeah department. Yes, and it's often now that they are even taking out the benches, because I remember me again. I remember me like in several like in in in in France. People like
most of the I've been to a couple of several train stations in France.
and it's extremely annoying, because there is very, very limited space to sit. I remember one specific train station that was on 1 one of the places that I lived.
I I I was always very annoying. I know I did there, because I mean there was no no place to pay like, no no place to sit. So you would see that fast area. You could buy some costs, you know, you could buy some coffee, but like, you know, there's no place to say it. So continues Remove yeah, yeah, the the camps. Yeah.
but it's like it, but that that agree, or it's nice. It's a nice example, but it's more like an action.
This bench that the Park Bank is a very nice architecture. It it showcase the architecture.
I get help like that. I can't. I just see this question here because everyone's visible. But
how is it ever the like. We know there is no visibility. You have you? You kick people out, you, and therefore they become they become hidden. I mean they. You hide them away. So the panopticon is. Is the is this the the the the the this idea that
you know it's a it's a kind of I mean
again.
It's a kind of I mean it. It's almost like you don't do surveillance in there you you like in this model. I mean, that focus is talking about. There is no surveillance in there, you know, but, like what he did was he used this to think about. Okay, this excludes that does not include that that does not include it. And then he use those 2 ideas
to think about surveillance. Doesn't mean that you know. You know enough. If we go back to the Bible example in our valley, where there's a lot of you know, like a leprosy I mean doesn't mean that there's surveillance there. No, that's not what full call was doing. It was just kind of getting those examples to get inspired. I can go back to that later. Valencia. Okay.
Is it ironic? Let me see here.
Yeah, it it is ironic, you know
it is.
Oh, Uk: Matthew, it's just the I mean, Uk is
the birth of surveillance studies and also surveillance. Okay, so like of all the in in the West, I would say that well United States kind of catched up. But like the Uk is just like huge. It was one of the first countries to kind of deploy cameras, and I think I believe that it is to the the country, the the area of the world, I mean. You know, the countries that we know group of countries that has the most amount of of a certainless cameras.
So China Doesn't I mean China is is top top top of the world in terms of surveillance. But i'm talking about the Western world right like.
Yes, Exactly. So I appreciate your example, your comment. Thank you. Okay, people. So look
here.
Are you all good, Valencia and everybody else. Can I move ahead.
Yeah, no.
I can come back to stuff later, because I always okay. Good.
Okay. So people look power. The principles on power, according to Ben Benton's and Foucault.
So power is visible.
Okay.
So so like
it, it's again. You You are always in there, you know, like you. You are always under visibility.
and it is very few verifiable. So you'd never know if you are actually gonna watch it. You don't know again. It's just like I told you guys I don't know, like in my credit card, like I get the impression. I am under the impression that my credit card right now is not under surveillance.
because there's nobody here in my room but but but it is because there is a system out there that is, is kind of as as as soon as I stemmed up in here, leave the house and swap my card. They will catch me, so i'm i'm being monitored, even though there is no cameras in here. There's nobody, even though the card is in my pocket. So there is a system that monitors and it sees. Okay, Marcellus card is stand still
nothing is happening, but that in itself is a piece of information. Okay, so so power is unverifiable. So the symbol in fucose writing is this Venetian blind that you kind of. You know why? Because you don't you you cannot just no way that you know there is. There is visibility coming you coming through and or not. It depends how you adjust.
and and people will know if you are seeing them or not. Okay. So just kind of
metaphor or also zigzag opening, you know, Sometimes.
like, instead of having a door, they go through. You have to go like you go inside, go on your left on your right, and then you, you know you go into the room that's called zigzag openings, you know. So that is just an example of like, you know something that you don't really know what's happening. Right? So
so essentially, I mean this. This part here is interesting for you guys to read later, you know.
But like, you know, but but the the what's the in it's like. Let's read the An optical is a machine for this, the associating
the C. And P. C.
Did so. You don't know I mean it. It's kind of you, don't know, because, like you know, without surveillance. You know that I mean that you know that I i'm watching you. But in a panoptic, and people don't really see, you know, like they don't know that when the guards is actually looking when the guards not looking so, and also something that I didn't say that tower.
you know.
like they're they're They're like 360 degrees windows, and then they use like, you know, the divination blinds. So that's you know that's kind of so that's why people don't really know if where the guard is looking right. So
so he sees everything you you know we thought we'd seen, so that's why you know visibility. This like to see is about visibility. So that's why you know for it to think surveillance. You need to think about this like Anthony, you can see, or you don't see on and off right like
people
here.
What is powered in? Is it a person because we
we tend to think of power as a person, as someone doing something to us.
But no.
So you know. Is it an authority, a figure of authority according to full call? No
power according to full call is this environment
where this environment, where you know
you, you are always being controlled. So it's not like, and that's that's major for you people in both science. I'd like you to remember that whatever.
like the most contribution that Full has to Paul, science is that it, like he came up with like a a definition of power or conceptualization of our
that takes power away from that idea. That power means government. That power means, you know, usually government, like you know, or a person a person in a position of power? No, for full call. Power does not lie with me, you know, like the teacher doesn't have power
like, and also. I didn't put that on this slide. But for full call, power is not is not something that you can grab on on that that you can. You can hold, you know, like this spray here. You know
the power is not that you cannot. It's it's not a thing that you can like. Grab like that power happens in the relationship.
So power is this relationship that we have with the environment which includes everything, from humans to cameras, to everything, to we rules organizations, institutions.
Is this clear people?
I really need you to remember that. Okay. So his contribution is this: like breaking the idea that power is government, and I know that for Paul Science that is kind of oh, my gosh! That's not what I've seen so far, because
I don't know how poly science goes here in Canada, but you usually talks about like you study a lot like you know, like hop hopes or hopes. Hope is, you know, like the hope is in state. Lock, Russo, and then you learn that you know power is the state and the and then, like all of a sudden, No, it's
No. And that's why people call for coast power micro power. Okay, micro power.
Okay.
So
So anyways, and also power according to full call, is very, very economical. There is no waste.
There's no waste.
and it's actually very profitable, very like, you know. It's very useful, very economical. I mean that the word is actually economical, because just like I told you, it's like one person
gonna watch many people.
So it's like, you know. You don't have to pay like, you know, and that has to do with the geography. Because if you alter that geography of that panopticon, then you're gonna have to pay more guards to watch. Let's suppose it's a reason you're gonna have to pay more of security guards or correctional officers to take care of it
right like, but because it is but the way that it is
it is. There is no waste. There is no waste of waste of resources. Okay.
it it's very precise. Okay.
So far so good.
We're gonna. I'm gonna finish this slide and move to the next one. Okay.
Okay. So we see more people here. This this is good. I'm happy to see all of you guys so far. So it's clear people.
Hey? I am gonna go share my slide with you here. Okay. So now.
So look, I try to. What we did was we started the course with
just
we talked about literature, you know, and then we went from literature. We we talked about for call. We talked about Delus. And and
so now we're gonna actually, you know. Now, you kind of have the foundation. Now you are able to kind of see. You should be able to see different types of power, different types of governance, like different types of surveillance, and all those words they boil down to sort of the same thing. We're talking about monitoring control.
Okay.
So let's talk about privacy now.
So look switching gears Here, privacy.
I don't have my watch, my my phone here, people. How much time do I have? Just so I can time up myself. Can someone down on the chat?
Okay, so wonderful. Okay, let's go. Let's get going. I want to finish this. I want to do this whole class today. So look.
we're going to talk about privacy, and we're going to discuss the article by this guy called Daniel. Okay, it's called privacy
an umbrella, an umbrella term for a plurality of things. So essentially like. Let's kind of you know the purpose of this. This. This first article is just to kind of get you thinking about privacy.
and then in the next art what? We're gonna actually talk about some legislation. Okay. But i'd like to take kind of make you think about it what that is. And then, you know, okay, if people wake up, get some coffee, what is privacy?
What is that? Don't Don't look this like? Just tell me on the chat. I mean, what's privacy for you? I mean for you don't do sociology, you know, like just just or or what part of science or technology just like. Tell me what is privacy for you? As if your own words and you know.
Okay. So
like everything that is for me to see to know. Okay, so this is private, not being monitored. Yeah. Well, the this is a good one. Yeah, all of them the fastest in my life and stuff that, you know that is not controlled, that I would be on
uncomfortable. Okay stuff that you wouldn't share, you know, and comfortable sharing. You know stuff that
how feasible. You are okay, okay, Good. So let's see what else the ability to keep your personal information away from the public eye environment.
an environment where you perceive to have a decent level of isolation. Okay, so you're saying, privacy is kind of some sort of isolation having agency over your own visibility. Okay, so Look
you you guys are, you know. Yeah, you're You're there. We're gonna come to a definition here. So look at this.
The first thing I like to to keep free. To keep in mind
is the interaction between surveillance and privacy. Okay, before we even think about privacy, let's just think about like how those 2 things interact surveillance people implies agents like implies an agent
who, you know, look into your personal data. So surveillance means data collection. It means monitoring. So that means that someone, some sort of system, some sort of agent, will look into personal data. Okay, that's kind of surveillance
and privacy is about restricting access to personal data. So that's what actually, privacy is. So privacy is
to restrict access.
But the problem is, you're gonna have bomber cell. This is so broad. So privacy. Actually it it has to do with isolation. The person who said isolation it has to do with isolation.
but not in not the sense of like you being away from society? No, it is in the sense of like your data being isolated from those who should not, you know, look into it, or you know, or you being able to kind of protect your data. In that sense. He has isolation.
you know. But to some extent all of what all, all of you. You said something that kind of goes. It boils down to this idea of, like you being able, you know, to restrict
access to your own data, right? So it doesn't make sense to you guys, I mean. So remember those 2 things.
There is an interplay here. So surveillance means someone looking into your data, and privacy means you limiting, restricting. You know, someone's ability to look into your data. Okay, let me see the chat, because now
it's getting
not be monitored. Yeah. So it's not real, Jacob. Really. Good. Yeah. So that would go back to that broad question. Yes, so. But you see now that we are kind of thinking together here, and we are getting more scientific.
It is so privacy, I mean. Again, of course, I ask what you guys I mean I I appreciate. Thank you for your answers, I mean, I asked, like from your mind and what you think. But now that now I invite you to kind of come to the text.
and in the taxes like it's about. You know privacy about restricting information. So look, privacy does not mean it does not mean not be monitored.
It means limiting. You know, that monitoring. You know the the access to that data that's been collected, or to them monitoring to the act of being monitored.
Is, does it make sense?
So let's just see what I need something here not being monitored, or at least I okay, yeah. So privacy is the right
to refuse.
Not necessarily. Not yet. I mean, I didn't talk about any right yet. I mean, it is like this idea that you can restrict. So it would be the right to restrict.
Yeah, you could say right to refuse. You could say, refuse not. This is not going to be used. Okay, you could put that that way, but it don't don't put it in terms of rights yet. I don't want you guys thinking about like human rights or as a right. I want you to think about the action. Just think about the action.
Okay, like. So that's what privacy is. So it boils down to that action. Okay.
let's see what else you here.
So look.
what do they have in common service and privacy?
So it's about information control. So both of them surveillance and privacy. Both both things are about information control. Because again, if if I am doing surveillance on you.
I am controlling the information, and and and if you know, and if you are kind of, you know, like trying to protect your privacy, you are trying to protect the information that can be shared, and the information that cannot be shared right so, and surveillance can invade privacy. You can.
It does that right? So quite often. It does that.
However, privacy
also can protect surveillance.
You guys get what i'm saying you can. You know you can use surveillance to invade privacy, and you can use privacy, loss to protect surveillance. So you know, this surveillance is gonna happen, because here, you know, we need some privacy. So therefore, you know, we need to collect data.
So it it goes both ways. Surveillance can.
Yeah. So it can for a survey and and and surveillance can protect privacy. So
it's about information control. It is about surveillance. He can invade private privacy. Privacy can protect surveillance, and and also vice versa.
Okay, so keep those things in mind. I want you to kind of keep this because
the way that we are taught in society is that almost like that privacy is this value?
It's a bad way in itself.
We are not thought
to think about privacy as an action.
And now I mean you guys are here, and this is university. This is supposed to be science. So like it's no longer about like moral values and and judgments. Of course, I mean in the end we go to there because I mean, you know. But first you need to understand it, like, you know, in the more kind of cold way.
you know, and be very aware that I mean, because we tend to think of privacy. Something that is so is good.
Not necessarily, not necessarily, you know.
Sometimes the privacy of their home, the privacy of the home, the privacy of the family can hide, for example.
child abuse.
So you know. So you have to kind of. So as a researcher. You need to be always aware that it can go both ways. You
let me just see
the chat. It is a double. He is like, yeah, double edge sport, or even a catch kind of 22, right, as you guys say in English. So
so but keep this in mind. So. Look. This is like the guy that that wrote the text that we are writing today, Daniel. And here's the book. So you just can see, because I I like to kind of give you guys the the text and the book, because then it kind of give sense. You know what you're reading and what's coming from.
where it's coming from. Look.
Let me give you now the main idea from this text, the main idea, the new idea here is very, very easy.
However.
it's so easy that you make make you guys kind of second get yourself, or even confused.
The idea here is that privacy is a social concept. Okay, right now.
privacy is a social concept. Okay, myself. But that means what
that means a lot. Because when you say that something is social.
that's something that means that it means that something changes over time. It varies according to culture, if there is according to time and space.
So when I say privacy is social.
we can. You guys can go back to this chat, and you're gonna see how social privacy is, because, like several people kind of gave their opinion and how they feel about privacy and what is privacy for them, and a kind of more intimate, more individual level. And each person said this: All the people here. They say they said different things. You guys said different things
right? So for some people with isolation for them, for another one is to be able to monitor the information that's out there about themselves, you know, for other people. It's just, you know.
It's not not being seen, you know, to be like in in in hide, I mean so like, say, various people. So if there is within this class.
like the understanding of privacy, it varies within Canadian society, and if we were to go broader and look at time and space, if there is even within Canada, you know, if we look back 100 years ago.
like the notion of privacy in Canada, like the general kind of notion, was one, and 200 years ago was more, and then 300. Me. You know it so essentially.
This concept, because it is a social concept. It is always changing.
and the like. The understanding of privacy today is not going to be the understanding of privacy tomorrow.
Okay.
and even you, as you grow in your life as you mature, all of us doing myself. Our understanding of privacy changes, you know. Perhaps now you know you don't do things that you like back in high school. You are like, oh, Jesus! How did I do that.
How did I expose myself like that? Right? Because your understanding of privacy change it from teenager hood into youth? Right? So you change it. So let me. Just see here in the chat
you can't have privacy. No one respected.
Hmm. Yes, true, I mean. But the thing is that that the idea that information is restricted. I mean it. It is everywhere. I mean to some extent Everybody's gonna to that to some extent. You know what I mean, like.
So what I want for now, Jessica is be don't don't go into like.
you know, don't think of privacy as at this, for now I mean as this absolute value. That is something always good.
you know, because again.
not necessarily can go both way and Don't think of surveillance as being something that all is always is bad for privacy, something that always intrudes on privacy, because that's not always the case. You You get the point. That's what i'm trying to kind of I'm. Trying to deconstruct, like the common knowledge that we have
about privacy, because the call knowledge is all priv is good, everybody wants privacy
not necessarily, and also another common knowledge of surveillance goes against privacy. Not necessarily.
Is this like making sense?
So look.
when you think about privacy, Usually you gotta think about the notions of public, and say that of public and private, because that those 2 notions, which is very geographical.
they help define what's private and what is public.
and that helps to define the notion of privacy.
Okay, so. And but those 2 notions of public, public and private, private. It changes to over time they choose our social concepts.
Okay. So i'm gonna go back to some example that I actually cited to you. I said that. But I didn't. I want to go back to that because I, wanna you know, make you guys memorize. So I told you that when I moved to China
in 2,001 what that was when I first arrived in China
to do my master's degree all my classmates. They were all Chinese. I was the only known Chinese person. So all my classmates
they were, you know. They had a very like China at the time. If, if it was funny, had the sense of uniformity people they were doing, you know.
very similar things, even like the color of like, you know, guys, they were always, you know, dressing black or brown, or, you know, some sort of dark color. And girls they were dressing kind of, you know, light purple, like just like this kind of p
that you see on the screen, or bege, beige, or, like, you know, like very light callers. And it was very uniform, and and the understanding of privacy was that I mean, you know, like the women, it was very gender based. So women they would be in front of each other
like that. That would be a of an issue they would exchange calling they would take. They would like
wash themselves in the evening before going to bed in front of everybody, their their their classmates. So imagine you, you
living in the dorms here at the of a, and then you know you, you, you know you wash yourself in front of your classmates, your your your roommates, you pee in front of them. Isn't that like for you for me at least, coming from Brazil. It wasn't even Canada us I was like.
Oh, this is too much for me. I can't do this, you know, and even I told you that, even like you know, popping was like there was no forest in the toilet, so you would actually go into the washroom, like, you know, next to your classmate.
Can you imagine this situation.
and this is a kind of more personal life, kind of more day to day life, experience, a more kind of scientific or or research related example would be, you know, for me as a researcher. It was very hard to do research in China, because to do research means
that you're going to survey someone. You're going to interview someone, and in the case of social sciences, and for them they are understanding.
Their information was private, and only the government which is public, could demand so for them to see a researcher. You know a master's students to ask them about their lives.
They didn't want to talk to me, not because I was a foreigner, that my classmates they had the same kind of problems, because in the Chinese mindset was okay. This is private information, and only the Government can have
my private information, and here in Canada is the opposite.
for perhaps you might be more likely to tell your about your life something about your life to you know. To me a researcher you're going to trust probably better me as a researcher than the Government than the police. Then you know some someone who is from the Government.
So what i'm trying to see here is that to show here is this kind of new ones, I mean, you know, and even China today. And it's so funny because China changes so much. It's a society that's what I like about China changes like.
you know. I mean what it took us 500 years to change China changed like.
you know, the equivalent of 500 years in the West. It happened like in in, you know, in in 4 decades in China. So China, so you are able to see society changing, which in in the West you cannot, because you would have to live for a 100 years 300 years, you know, to be to see kind of major major changes.
So in China also. Another thing that today is different. When I go back to China I see all the the toilets they have doors, you know. I mean, you know, like in the countryside china, people used to share a bedroom like a not only not on a bedroom. Sorry, I said wrong. They used to share a bed.
So parents and kids, they would all asleep. There was this very large large beds, and underneath they would. They would put Poll to heat to work because there was no heater in the country sign. That was 2,000. You know the years of 2,005,
and and they would all kind of sleep together. So let's suppose the parents they want to have some sex. For example, there's no privacy right like
because of the geography of the bed. There's no privacy. Everybody's there together. So how do you do you? You wait until the kids go to sleep, and then, you know, if you want to do something you do in a hidden way. Right? So it's like that's that was, you know. I'm just giving you those examples. So you see.
But now you don't see that in the countryside anymore you don't you don't people don't share bad in China anymore, You know Chinese dramatically, and if you share bad with someone now in the countryside. It would feel the same as in Canada if I if I visit you guys, and then you know
you. I remember when I went to the countryside for the first time.
a friend of mine I mean not a colleague of mine, wasn't even my friend. I went to her house. And then I said, okay, there is just one bed. There's just like 2 beds, your 2 bedrooms like your parents and and this one here. So would you like me to sleep in the couch, you know, and or I can. I can do something here, rug or something, so I can sleep on the floor. She was like No, no, no! You sleep with me.
and then I was like.
Oh, how do I go about this thing right like for me. It may I? I indeed we share the bad, but I I felt super super uncomfortable, because my understanding of privacy is embedded in me, that I mean that sleeping is a private section
that i'm not supposed to to do that with people that are. You know that I barely know. Do you guys get what i'm saying? Are you guys in there? Is it making sense to you or everybody is gone? Let me see.
So is it? I mean
It's interesting. Isn't it like when we think about those things. Now you're gonna i'm gonna put you to think even more about this transformation, because this whole chapter is about like is about this idea of trying to put in your mind to show you.
You know how this notion of privacy changes, and that's why I don't want you to think that it is a a fantastic value, because you know it changes. I mean, it's something that keeps changing.
and he has to do with the understanding of public and private
perfect. Okay. So let me just see this last.
Yes, Nicole, you're very, very right. Okay. Very right. China changed a lot because of the money that they have now. So look at this family. Let's talk about family. And again, here I am going to follow the structure of the reading. Okay, family.
So let's go in there very quick. I'm going to summarize the reading for you. So look, family people.
family.
I'm gonna actually start here, family.
the way that we used to form family to marry, you know.
It was before, like not a long ago, like, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, depending on the country
or the area of Canada. For example, we used to form families based on love. No, there was no law. It was about economical interests, economic interest, religious interest, politics, social
even like you need. Yet today, you know, we have the caste system in India. So how do you marry? It is about money. It is about religion is about social. It's more cast. Oh, but I love someone with Strong. No, you're not going to marry that person right? So so you know. So, family you like, you know. You should be very kind of public.
like the way that we form family. He had to do with our parents. He had to do with their interest. He had, he had to do with the interest of the community. So it was sort of public.
And now families they are, you know, the idea of forming a family, you know, if they can, private, it's no longer public.
I mean it's about you if you love, or if you don't love all Marcella. But I am in Canada and my my parents they are from. Let's say Sri Lanka, and and they, you know they still kind of, even though they are in Canada. They they think that I should marry someone from my cast. Yeah, I mean that that has with the immigration. You know, the disparity mindset integration.
But yeah, but because you know what's nice about those examples that sometimes I hear in class is that you can see, like you know, 2 kinds of understanding of family, you know, like one that is kind of families private, another one of families public in the same country in Canada. Right? So so let me just go back in here. So sexuality people
your sexuality. When I see sexuality, i'm not talking about sex talked about sexuality and not
like it. It is a now it is a per a matter of personal choice. It is a matter of individual identity. You guys take that for granted because you are 20. You are 2122 2325, you know. But if you were 40 or above 30 you would not take that for granted.
Okay, before. It was not like that, you know, even like this script, the way that you made the way that you rate.
You know people the way that you it's all personal. The best example that I can think about is tender. Look at tinder.
It is all about like you is all about your taste. It is all about like what you like, and what you just like it is about your identity.
you know.
So we have Greer here. I remember how hard you was for a woman, for a young queer won't be. Oh, yes, exactly. It's very hard, because there was 0 space for this idea that oh, I want to be myself. No, no, no! If you have, you know a female Jennifer you're going to marry, and that's it. If you have me and you're going to be my Mary opposite Jenny. That's it. And there's no change. There's no nothing. There's no identity, All but I cannot be who I am your problem. And if you want to go back in Canada, and you know Alberta is too late.
Sterilization act. You could even be deemed, you know, a meal like a unwell, or you know mentally you and you could be sterilized. Right? So so, anyway. So
so look
the idea that family
can be formed based on emotions which is a very, very new idea that you guys take for granted.
It even changed the way that we define family in Canada. This is I have for here this slide, this slide
and this line, those 3 lines they are I I I went out of my way to show you, and I took for you to the the official definition of family. According to statistics, Canada.
So you see, in 1,949, a family was a group of parents and children characterized by common residents, economic corporation reproduction. So if you are parents, and you don't reproduce.
you are not a family
That was 1,949 in Canada, so we'd look at like later. I'd like you guys to read those, but we expedite, you know. And now look at the definition.
Our family Canadian statistics, Canada from 2,016.
Look at how broad this definition is. As i'm talking to you. Please take a look at this, you know. Skim through it. I mean. It's extremely broad, and you pretty much is almost like, okay, I I I can call anyone who I want to call family.
you know. So essentially the family became a private matter all myself. But my parents from Sherland are from Brazil or from yeah. I mean, they are exceptions, obviously, but I mean in general. That's we're talking about trends. That's the Trendy Society. Okay?
So.
Marcel, Why are you talking about family again? Because i'm trying to show you how privacy.
the notion of privacy evolved in society, so family was public. Now it's private. So whatever it was, privacy and public change it. When we talk about, you know, a family.
So
so far, so good people.
any comments, any anything, anything that you know.
Okay, i'm gonna keep going. I I like to just to ask a favor, because I don't have my cell phone in here, and I want to go fetch, and I don't even know where that is when it's like 5 min to finish. Just can you just tell me on the chat or so? It's 5 min down time? Okay.
Body, let's talk about body
again. I'm going with the text. Okay, so just make it easier for you to dissect and understand the text.
So, body people is private today.
Think about. Give me an example. Give me some evidence that the body is private.
Valencia. Yeah, as I understand you.
Yes, it can be irritating. And and people
tell me here, I mean, give me some evidence that shows that the body is private.
Yes, wonderful. We wear global thingss. What else?
Yes, Jessica.
Let's get to the sexual south domain.
There is this idea, that of consent. The very idea of consent People is built on the assumption that the body is private. Do you agree with me?
This whole idea of consent that we have now in in Western countries, like not all of them, but many of them, it Canada. We do have that. I mean nobody can have sex with you, you know. Accept that you you on a on you give consent.
You're not allowed to by the wall. Right? So that that is built on the idea that that's the evidence that today's private buy is private
ability to make all those decisions about your body as true. True, this is true. You can, you know I can make a talk to. I can put on a piercing I can. I can pierce my my ears. I can cut my hair. However, I want it was not like that before.
Well, women, they would have to have to wear long hair, man, short hair, you know some period of time, beard some periods of time. No beer beer less, you know. Like to, you know, like some some periods of time. You you could, you know you're supposed to have a year ring in some societies who do some Besides, you don't, you know, like you know, and you like. It's almost like your body was conditioned by the gender that you had, and and in the social class, and you were born in so me you had pretty much no freedom over your body.
Now, again we take this for granted.
like even like the outfits that we wear.
we are free. We but we don't realize how how free we are, or we are autonomous when we choose our outfits every day in the morning. But that was not the case, like, you know.
30 years ago it was not the case 30 years ago.
Okay.
So look
here, people, look it's just an example of how it was not always the oh, oh, hold on a second!
If you go back!
The body was public People
was a public site, a public space almost.
And that's why, when you go back to Greece in time, if we were going to go back 2,000 years ago, you know, like this guy that you see here. By the way, this is a very famous sculpture. It is in in Naples, the Museum in Naples, in Italy, and this is Hercules, I think, in English is here. At least that's how you say
so. I mean that kind of sculpture, I mean, if they expect from 2,000 years ago. That was, you know, normal, I mean, that was the example of a beautiful body, and and then the body was public was something to be shown. We don't do. I mean, we don't even like, you know.
some some some parents, when they take children to do a museum. I've seen it. I've seen it actually in Europe, like parents taking, you know, in in in Paris, I mean the very famous Move Museum. They have a lot of like naked, you know, statue like statues like that. And you see parents kind of, you know, feeling awkward, you know. Sometimes I love watching those things like it's mid surveillance on the people who go, you know, to see. So I kind of, I think, about no visibility body all those things that are discussing, and I watch.
So you see that families are all uncomfortable because that is not longer the case, right like.
So
I had some notes here, and I just see something.
Yeah. So. And you know, in in Greece
the only type of body that was hidden was whatever was the ugly body according to the standards all the time the ugly body at that time would be the body that you have muscles, right like.
Okay. So
look even like the idea of the idea of going to the washroom.
This idea that I talked I I gave my personal example by China.
but even in the West, you know, until, like the late nineteenth century
people would go the toilet like I mean, I gave you some nice team, which is how toilet, but like oh, obviously at that time toilet toilet. They were just holes, you know, somewhere, you know, like or just the bush depending on where you lived right at the time, but like this idea that you know you go like we have this very private idea.
and i'm gonna say some funny things here. But I mean it. I mean, think about in Canada and elsewhere in the Western world.
We even see the order rent for for bad smell from the from the toilet.
Right? So I do have some friends in Canada. They are. When they go they have to go into Washington. They are not there, sick or something they are concerned about.
you know, like the smell. They're concerned about the noise I have heard I mean I the When I teach my students they tell me fun stores. I'm going to share with you. So those stars I collect them in class with people, you know we discuss those things.
but, like I, I hear of people that they when they go in the Washington school especially, they have their favorite washroom because they want to privacy. You know. I hear of people that they throw some paper on the toilet, so there's no noise there's no splashing. So you know people, humans. They do all sorts of crazy things to ensure their privacy
when they go in the washroom. But that wasn't the case. You know those actually, they were not private, and I and that's what I like about China. I had the chance to actually experience China in a period when you know that was not private, and I felt later. I used to like a couple of years. Now I was like I don't care, I mean, you know, but like. But you know, when I first arrived it was very hard for me.
and I could feel the weight of society me telling me this is very.
This is too public for you
sex people. Sex is another topic in the book in the in the reading. So i'm i'm. Kind of I broke by, you know, by by the titles. So sex is another one
when we've sex people has always kind of been private, I mean, if you even if you look back to couple of 1,000 years ago, I mean, sex has always been something that's private.
But, however.
I mean the privacy of sex, it depended. It depended
on the amount on on social press. Just the example that I gave you about the bad in China.
and that's why I have this pack of.
I couldn't find a better picture, but I think this one's gonna stick to your mind. I mean, think about the wife and the husband and a lot of kids share the same bed in China. Just just example that I give you, I mean obviously rich people. They have spare rooms where they could go and have sex. But for people they did not
right, so they would have sex, you know they would try to get some privacy somewhere in the push of Don't know where, but but also sometimes it would happen in a public setting like in the bedroom. They had more people over, so it doesn't mean that it's gonna go crazy. No, I mean people would. Heights, too, you know. Do it right to it as silent as possible.
So so this is an example that you know
of how kind of like surveillance and the idea of privacy. How that intersects with social class, you know.
So for the rich people no problem for the for for people it can be a problem home. The home is another site
which Daniel they offer used to think about privacy and and and and
you know, like how privacy change it. So we tend to think of the home
as
Oh, I put the slide in the wrong one.
No, this is out of order.
Sorry people like before we talk about all i'm gonna I'm gonna have to revise the slide before we talk about home. Let's just talk about this slide. Here we have 2 slides. Talk about. I I misplace them.
So let's just go back before we talk about home. Let's continue to talk about sex or sexual life. So look.
even though sex. I told you that sex has been something that has fairly much been like, you know, you know. Always kind of private, you know, like I just told you that. However.
there is some sort of like like not always. I mean it's not. I mean, you know. For example.
if you were deviant in terms of like your sexuality, I mean, if you deviate from the norm.
whatever was the norm, the norm, like back in the in time was, you know, if you were a woman. You're gonna marry a guy. So if you were a woman and you had, you know, an affair for another woman that would be a deviation back in the days right like in some countries.
even this day, that the deviation can be punished. But like. But in Canada, back in the days and here Canada, us and Europe so so. But even those of sex was private.
That did not mean that you could do whatever that didn't mean that. Oh, I you know, since it's kind of it has been private for a long time. I'm gonna go and have sex with my my friend, who I love. No, that doesn't work, you know, so like any kind of deviance, was harshly punish right like. So
keep this in mind. Oh, I my slides there all to order. Geez.
I skipped some of them, I think.
Okay. So yeah. So anyway, i'm gonna put them in the right order. But like, so we're talking. We we continue to talk about sex. So I gave here again. I mean the the Sterilization Act in Alberta is the best example that I can give you of people being punished
for their sexuality, or because a lot of the people who were deemed ill. They were Lgbtq. 2 plus people, you know a lot of them indigenous people, as we discussed
indigenous women as as we discussed, but also Lgbtq 2 plus. But obviously at that time there was no it was just homosexuals, right? That was the kind of the the terminology. So I gave here from you just like I really like this article
that was actually written by Jenna Greco. She's a professor at the Us. Criminology, and this is not for the exam. People. It's just so. You know that in case you want to like, dig deeper into this sterilization act in Alberta?
Take a look at this article. Okay, because she does all those archive or information that I told you about that. It is at the Alberta Museum. She analyzes them. Okay, and it's a it's a good article. So
i'm not saying here.
I told you that.
Yeah, I mean, if they are like all displaced. I'm: so sorry.
So we talked about sex. Let's go back to talk about the body, because I mean, you know those lies there actually about the body. I don't know what I did here, you know.
anyways, body. So we're gonna flip back to body. Just so. I can talk about this ideas in here. So look.
But I told you guys, that body is now private, and you you agreed with me on the chat.
But even though it's private, we do have, like abortion, is still a super contentious issue. Super
here in Canada, even you know, in the United States. But here in Canada we do have protection over abortion. But in the United States now we're going back
like that. Protection has been removed, you know. So not not fully, but like now it's it isn't the power of the state of the the the the States, not the not the Federal government. But this the State Government, not because here we call provision right, but like there's State.
so it hasn't been removed the protection fully. But now it is up to the State to determine if they're going to cover. If you're going to be providing for for a choice, right? So so so we still. So I mean why I brought this here.
It's about control. Yes, and why did I bring this here? Because I want to show you that I mean society. So essentially i'm telling you look privacy. The idea of privacy. It's changing.
but sometimes it doesn't change like in a linear way it doesn't go like, you know.
like always know. Sometimes it goes. It comes back a little bit. Here. It changed, you know. Sometimes it change regarding sex, but it doesn't change regarding body, you know. So it's a lot of contradictions which is fine. I mean, that's what society is right. Like. Society includes a lot of contradictions.
So another another one about the body is the be true movement. Right? That, I mean is an example of how you know the body is becoming more private. But again, you know. And now we go back to home. So yeah, so you see, I have to fix this slide. But anyways.
so home people
used to be. You know it has been a private kind of setting for a long time.
and if you read the article, you're gonna even see that home like our homes.
I mean they were castles right like you did this like if you travel with France is the best example for you to see this. I mean, you're gonna sell a lot of castles. I mean, the home was a cancel.
right? So we usually tend to forget that, you know we think of it's almost like in our minds castles. They became a category in themselves. But no, but they are homes, their houses. It's just that we don't build them that way anymore, but their homes
right so, and it's like they have been a private setting for a long time.
But here, you know, it. It varies up to money as well. Not everybody obviously had the money to build a castle. Okay, so
so for for people who are poor, I mean.
you know they don't have any privacy in their home. I mean their home was like shared, and you know, when they had to leave I mean, you know they have to use whatever facilities that they had. But now it is, you know, we tend to think of our homes as as more private right like. However, even though they're very rich people.
or you don't even have to be that reach but a lot of people you usually reach.
They have, like a you know, in their homes they have an office. Well, now, if the pandemic you changed everything. Anyone has an office, even me. I have an office here like in my place, but, like you know, which is not even my place is. An so you know it's, an that has an office. So it's like, you know. See how popular, dedicated to the pandemic, but, like you know, but like essentially like a lot of the like higher income classes, people, they have a library in their houses, and, like they have, like a home Home Office spot, and it uses the library for kind of work, classy.
And then that library is where, if you ever need to conduct any kind of private bill, a public business in the house, you'd do it there.
So let's suppose You are a business person here in Edmonton, and you are reaching. You have a library. You have some sort of like steady in your house, and then someone comes to talk to you about whatever business you're not gonna have them over dinner like in the in at the dinner table. You might give them dinner. But you're gonna, you know. Invite them to this study so you can, you know, have this kind of discuss this this topic. That is, it is private for you, but it's a public topic. It's not like about your family. It's about business, business, business life, right? So
So
also another thing that I want to add is that.
like this understanding of
like.
If we go back to medieval Europe
like people, they would live near castles, and they would have like the rich people, and they would have everything inside of their cancels. They would have like a barn. They would have everything in there, I mean, if you ever visit a castle? You have everything in there.
But then, you know at that time, I mean.
and people in poor people would just like live wherever they could find, you know, very simple accommodations or houses.
and then we fast forward a little bit. We go into the Industrial Revolution.
and then in the Industrial Revolution. This idea of castle it became kind of, you know too much. I mean it's too kind of inconvenient for the reach. So the rich kind of they change the way that they live. And the poor also changed the way that they live.
And and and this idea that you know that separation between usually the poor people. They move to the city with the industrial Revolution.
When you look at the history of the Uk, all the countries and and in the regions, you know, there is like an influx of migration to the cities Manchester, London, I mean, they're all suited to that. They were developed with rural migrants. They all came to work in the factories, you know, work like, you know.
in industry. And and then there was like a greater separation of this understanding of public and private regarding the home. So it's almost like, until the Industrial Revolution, the notion of public and and and private
or privacy involving the home for the reach was very blurry because they had the castle, for the poor also was blurry, because, you know, they would live work everything in the farm, in the you know, in the rural areas, agricultural life for the poor people, and after with the industrial Revolution.
both for poor and reach this idea of home being organized around like, or as a private space, it became more
it become. It became more obvious. So you know even the poor people. They have their homes, and then, like, if I was slow at the beginning, was like you do everything there. But then, slowly, with the emerges of emergence of factories. People would sleep in there in their homes during the day time, and during this the night time, and go work in a factory. So that was this division of of of
of labor. If you will, you know in that space called home you do certain things in that space called factory or workplace. You do all kinds of things. Is this clear folks?
Yes, no. Come on. Where is everybody?
Okay, Yes.
So look
So what I put in Here is some money for you, because what I always all everything that I said about the family at the house.
You know it. It it it's tied to money, I mean, you know you need to have money to have, you know, up a castle and and have everything in there. You need to have money to have, you know, a a place, and have a a study in, and or a library in your house, and stuff like that, right? So it goes according to money, and the last topic is communication.
Okay. So again, we take for granted that our correspondence is private. We don't think about that. It could be even otherwise.
But it wasn't
private until I would say, need eighteenth century. Okay, eighteenth century goes from 17, one all the way to 1,800 right? So that's that's the seventeenth century.
Oh, sorry! That's the eighteenth century. So I said, I said, 18 is right like mid eighteenth century.
Is that what I just said
Come on, people.
are you guys there.
hey? I'm gonna say it again. So it wasn't into around 1750, which is mid eighteenth century that our communications they became private. Okay.
So look sorry. Just sometimes it just go, you know, because if it feels like you're talking to the walls right like it's like you feel Sometimes I feel I was very used to teaching the pandemic
like online. But then, after I mean, now, I kind of. I feel weird again, just like in the beginning, when we first start, You know I feel like man. There's nobody here, you know. Is there anybody out there, you know, like, or I feel kind of crazy, you know, like Anyways.
thank you. Thank you for letting me know.
How could you have a communication breach in this. Yeah, people, would they would take you again? There was not that understanding that the letter that someone sent to you was yours, I mean anybody would read. So so let's suppose someone gives me a letter for Jessica
and say, is Marcel let's because i'm your mother, Jessica. This is a matter for you, for for for your, for your daughter. And I would go and say, Well, okay. And then I would just open up and read
that that understanding that a letter is something confidential, it wasn't there and then slowly, that understanding appeared in society and slowly, we created loss. Okay around that.
Yeah, exactly that. So
a lot to actually, now that you're talking, Jenna, there's I mean I I I don't know if I told you guys, my P. A. Is a social sciences. I have a triple major, including anthropology in anthropology. There's a lot of work on the on gossiping medieval times. You know. Actually, it's a very interesting topic. Anyways.
so communicate here, people.
Oh, I said, let me just think
i'm just think, because like it's 17 something. So I I put it role. I'm gonna fix this slide to, because it's eighteenth century, because eighteenth go from 1, 7, 0, one all the way to 1,800. So it's it's not 17, but 18. So i'm gonna fix this year.
Look.
I like to put this for you to think about it. I don't know if you guys are, are kind of, if you know that, like like the guy, Prince Harry from England.
from the Uk. He you go. He put it all the book, and I became very interested in the whole.
like discussion around the book. Because I kind of agree
with what Vanity Fair just said in there, I mean.
there is like people who like and dislike Harry and Megan I mean, you know the the people like the the royal family, and etc., etc. for me doesn't that doesn't really matter. I mean whatever you like, or just like. But what I found it's interesting is that they are trying, and those 2 they are trying to kind of re signify, reorganize
the concept of privacy when it comes to media and communications in England, in the in the whole Uk. Actually
not only in England. So so they are like, you know, so essentially like, so like you, Harry put out this book called spare. He's studying his story, and and and he's discussing media media like the way that they needed to to him they way that that the royal family uses the media. When is okay, when you know when it's like, you know. Kind of he's trying to draw those lines like, you know.
when Royal Family should talk to reporters, and when they should not talk to reporters, you know it's like it's almost like he's trying to draw his line. You know a line of the sand, and from what I got I gathered
It's it's almost like you're saying, you know it is okay. I mean, you know, I mean, I want to. I want to have access to the media. The media is a source of money for the royal family. And of course, yeah. So it's essentially well down to money. It's a it's a source of money and sustainability for the royal family. However, you know he's complaining. Okay, we should
benefit. But you know it's not okay when you get. You know things that are that I don't want up there. So it's kind of this debate.
You know him trying to draw this line on the sand, or what's right. What's wrong
that I find that very, very interesting for people with that surveillance. So, anyways, essentially, I just want to bring that up, because I don't know if if you guys are following, you know, if you know what's going on. But you know, keep an eye on there for that
and my final message for you. I hope I have one more. Do I have one more minute, people, one more minute or no. My time is up.
Okay. Great. Okay. Final message for you.
Very easy. So easy message. So the message here is society changes and we change our understanding of privacy as well as our laws around privacy
or some. But that's it. Yeah. So the guy like Daniel took a couple of pages like, you know, at the 10 pages, just to show you and I try to kind of reproduce all the themes that he talked about, just to show you, because when we first came, when you guys first come to the class to class, and I tell you it's almost like we all of privacy.
We don't think about privacy, and we all believe that privacy is always good.
Right? So
and and so i'm trying to kind of know. Look, Privacy is a is a social concept. It keeps changing. So Don't get too much attached to that, because probably by the time that you guys are old, I mean, you know that, like you're gonna see in your grandchildren
or in your relatives younger relatives, Another kind of understanding of privacy in the same way that I that I saw in China, you know. So keep that in mind. And then next class we're going to talk about like privacy loss.
E: including here, like the tax is more global. But i'm gonna bring stuff from Canada. Okay.
So i'm going to switch those slides back to the right? Position.
And and i'm going to re-approve them to e class.
That's all.
Thank you very much. I hope that this was like enjoyable, not too painful. And and thank you very much. Guys for coming. And you guys take care of yourselves. Mental health.
physical health study, you know.
Keep things in check. Not at all for my class, for everything, you know. Good luck with whatever you have to do and take care of yourselves. Okay.
you have a great day to people. If you have any questions to stay on the line.
I'm going to stop recording, but you stay on the line if you have any question.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.

<h1>Jan 31</h1>
  <p>
"Hello, everybody! Do you guys hear me? Do you see me? Well.
welcome back.
You have 18 people here live.
Let me see if it's recording and everything.
No, just double check. If this thing is recording.
Yeah, it is
sorry, folks.
Okay.
Okay. So
do you guys see me and this screen, or you see something else you're supposed to see, just like the Ppt. And my face. Yes, both. We're good. Then right like.
Okay, Good.
Okay, people. I, our colleague, shared something very nice with me today. Interesting?
Well, it's not pleasant, but it's really interesting. Is that, like there is this person in the United States that he was Scott like he murdered his wife, and he was Scott because of his Google searches.
So it's really interesting to take a look at it. And when I got Hannah's email I was like, okay.
I actually even replied to her that this is very nice. Thank you. And and and that's exactly why i'd like you guys to think of surveillance to kind of analyze surveillance. Not so much
just like try to think of the surveillance as bad or good, because sometimes surveillance is just excellent. Imagine if you were the family of that woman who was murdered, and now you, you know you know exactly what happened to her, because you know of the Google Search is that you know that the police, you know, got from the husband. So you know. So surveillance is, it's like, Of course, in society we on a personal level, we sometimes we we hate surveillance. Sometimes we love surveillance, or sometimes we just don't care about surveillance, but like
but for us here in this course, I mean my whole goal with this, you know, like
like teaching this course to try to kind of get people thinking about surveillance and
and and and understanding how surveillance works and and all those things. Not so much if it's good or bad. Okay, so take a look. It is on, you know, on on our e-class. I have a little section on the top of the page right like, you know, it's the second kind of section that I have in there with like resource that people send me. So you're gonna find the video in there as a short kind of t news video about this case. Okay, good. So today, oh, actually.
I notice last class. I noticed that I forgot
to go like, because sometimes I you know, I don't know why, like on zoom calls like sometimes you're passing the slides, and these like they stick together like they, you know. Sometimes you pass one, but it goes to so they are like one or 2 slides that I didn't talk about it.
and so i'll go back later. It doesn't have to be now. Later on, you you know i'll pass them, and I'll I'll let you make some notes about less class. Okay. So today, people, we're gonna continue to discuss privacy.
and we're gonna start. We have 2 topics to discover, to discuss and and discover. And the first one is a Ted Talk by Glenn Greenwald. I don't know if you ever heard of this name. Do you guys know Green?
Or a green wall like Glen Green. Wall, do you know this journalist? Anybody here? Have you heard of this guy before?
Yes, no
people.
Are you guys there?
Okay, You say, No? Okay. So yeah. So this guy is a very famous American. Oh, apparently not that famous American journalist. And he got the pool to a prize like a couple of times, and once actually, it's a very big prize in journalism. And another thing that I mean, he found it a society called
the Intercept.
You know it's called the output here in the chat, just for you know, intercept. So this is like he has this O. Ng.
and Joe, I think in English Ngo. Yeah, the Non Government organization. So he has intercept, and like the whole purpose of this organization, which now has branches all over, like in pretty much a lot of many countries is kind of to expose corruption exposed like dirty politics, so he's a very famous journalist, and by chance I mean, you know he is based actually in Brazil, where I am from.
He's American born and raised in the United States. He's been everywhere in the world, but he, he for his husband. He married a guy from Brazil. So and this actually his husband is a a member of the Parliament in Brazil, Lower House, you know, like Congress, but not Senate, like the House of Representatives, the Lower House.
And
and so he married this guy, and he's been in Brazil for quite a bit, and he's doing some like his organization is doing awesome work in Brazil, exposing corruption. Okay, like. And the way it works is like, you know, people's it's like a kind of a leak. You know thing that you know people leak information in there, and he uses of his.
you know, journalist status to protect the person who licked the document, and and then he writes about it, and he exposes like a piece of corruption. So so we're gonna watch a Ted Talk by this guy, and he is a very
and like he's I mean he's not as famous as Snowden, which probably you heard about because he licked
like huge amounts of of material from the from the Us. Government in the website, on the on the Internet. So probably you heard about Snowden, but but he's not as famous, but he's I mean he. They They know each other, I mean, they work kind of together. It's part of this big
web of people who, you know, are trying to fight for, you know, to make politics more open to the public. Okay.
So we're gonna watch his Ted talk. I'm gonna. I have a few questions about the Ted Talk to you. We're gonna work together, and then we're gonna, you know, Discuss a Join our article. So let's start with the podcast, the the Ted Talk. So i'm not sure it's gonna be my first time ever
using a zoom call to broadcast something. So i'm gonna play. We're gonna walk together.
But i'd like you to let me know in the chat if you don't see, or if you can't hear. You know. You'll tell me on the chat on the chat. Just check myself on working whatever, because I've never tried this before. Okay. So now i'm gonna stop sharing this screen here. Oh, and one more thing.
Can you see now, it's the time that doesn't pass like
Hold on a second
Here.
I would like to ask you people come on. I'd like to ask you
when you are watching it's a 20 min, 1520 min that talk when you're watching. I would like you to consider those 3 questions that you see in front of you
like the for the question Number one. What happens to us
when we are under surveillance. So you know, consider that. Think about that as you're listening.
and and see if you agree with what he said. He's gonna say, see if you have anything else to add to that.
The second question here is, what role does privacy play in our lives? Okay. So why is privacy important. We've kind of discussed a little bit, but like you to listen to him. And how does privacy
benefit society at large? Okay. So keep you. You have this line, so keep that with you, and I am going to go in here and play.
You should be ready to go and just try again. Here, share a screen.
Okay, here we go. Let's see if this is gonna work.
Please let me know if that works.
You're supposed to. Here.
Hey, people hold on a second.
I don't think it's gonna work
your I'm just ask you very quick. Your pros. Have they any of them like, you know? Broadcast stuff to you like in the lecture like this.
Has anybody done that before in in any of the yeah. Okay. So maybe it's just me. I don't know how to put this thing. Hold on a second. I'm! Just one more.
One more channel, one more trial.
Let me see what you guys are writing here.
I couldn't hear your presentations muted
could be that your presentation is muted.
Is it because maybe it is because I have my ear plugs right like. Usually they give us a few moments to watch. Yeah, I think i'm gonna go cool that good to go. Do that, You know. I just see.
Oh, okay, I I'll try and mute myself, Jessica. Just one more time. People very quick. If that doesn't work i'll give you time. You guys go watch, and then we discuss. Okay. So let's just try one more time here.
you know, and i'm going to mute myself.
Oh, my! I'm sorry
you're currently on mute. Oh, my gosh, people.
this is like a nightmare. Okay, so so sorry, people. Okay, what I said is, i'm gonna give you guys 15 min. Everybody go in there in the link. Let's watch all together. Each person does it from your own computer, and then we come back here and discuss. Don't. Leave the room. Just stay here. Okay. Is that okay? Everybody Can we do that?
Okay, Good. Let's go. Okay, 15 min. It's 1516 min is going to be more than enough, everybody now starting now. I'm going to mute myself, but i'm here because i'm going to watch too.
8 people just let let us know when whenever you guys are done. Okay. So okay, let's just wait 3 more minutes. So
people
we can skip the Q. A: okay. We can skip that just just so we can save time. But
okay, folks, let's get back in here, please. Everybody.
So look.
first of all, Did you guys, Did you find it interesting.
Did you like it? I mean, did that speak to you? Anything that you wanna
that you want to kind of? You know that's something that you like, or something that you did did not like.
Just share way here. Okay, I'd like to bring some some stuff for you here that I that called my attention.
Obviously this idea of like bad and good. You like you have things to hide and or you don't have anything to high that's really interesting, and that's something that has not appeared in our in our well. It appeared in it now 1 one of the articles that we we talked about it like that, you know, like the
some ideas are on surveillance that you know you have to be carefully like those people say, you know i'm not afraid, because I haven't nothing to hide so. And but like here he explored that better kind of you know this kind of dualist view. Well, you're bad. You're good, and that is a very simplistic and yet appealing organization of the world.
This is easy to say, oh, you are bad, you're good. This is good, this is bad, right? So if if it's, if it's very well when people say, oh, I have nothing to hide there, for I don't care about surveillance, right? So that that kind of you know it. It it clicks with like, you know, the the mentality around that you know the way you organize the side.
Another thing here that before I get to the chat that i'd like to to share with you is that
I really enjoyed what he said about
what could the measurement? If you want to know? If a society is free, the measurement is to see not how the society treats like it's. It's good citizens.
But how society treats, You know people who are deviant people commit crimes and everything. So that's where we can see if a society is truly free, because I mean, you know, he has a do process, a criminal justice system, or a justice system for the people who you know who commit crimes. Right? So one more thing. Here.
here's a comment that I like to bring something out to you
when he talks about the panopticon. Probably you heard, and probably now you know what that is. He says he says, Look, Jeremy Bentham. He thought of the panopticon as originally designed to be implemented in prisons.
This is incorrect. Okay, this is incorrect, Marcella. What is incorrect, like like like a a glen, he said. The panopticon, like, according to bell from you know, like, was originally originally designed to be implemented in prisons, and you, you can know for a fact if you go back to my slides. When we discussed the panopticon. I gave you a a huge quote.
you know, from Benton.
like you know, about the panoptic, and he says it it. It. It's useful for hospital it's used. It's useful for a reason that kind of architecture can use can be used in in hospitals, so it is in in the slides, and also like I gave you that quote, and that's why I also bent them. He knew that that architecture was multi purpose, and he even called in S. Penoptica. The title of the book is an opticon or Inspection House.
because, again, it can be it. It is an architecture for inspection. Okay? And I think that that's it pretty much. Let me just go back in here. So people saying that it is interesting, a good talk. Okay.
I yeah, I I don't. Yeah, Emma. Yes, I see what you're saying about. Nothing to hide, You know, Greer. Also nothing to hide and the things connected back yet, you know. Yeah. Oh, yeah, Selena, this is media definitely media studies. But people look.
Let's think about those those questions here.
What happens to us when we are under surveillance? What he's trying to say is that we change the behavior. We change right, like we behave differently.
and and we we, we, when we know that we are under surveillance. It's almost like we become this controlled kind of individual.
and we do self control right? So it's almost like, okay, I am. We go into this mode, you know, just like you know, our cell phone has the, you know, sleep mode, we know, like, okay, I am in public kind of mode, and and sometimes people tell me my lectures over sell up when I see a camera. I am so used to that that I don't change. I am just. I am just myself. I mean nothing happens to me. Therefore what Glen is suggesting is not quite accurate, because I just don't change.
But then I asked the person like you most most time when when you are, you know when there is a camera you may believe that you don't change.
but you do because you are in public, and your behavior in public is not the same as your behavior
in private. So the thing is that the the of public to us today in today's society.
Get the concept of being in public
already includes dealing, knowing that you know people are watching you
You guys get what i'm saying like we know that I mean, you know, like 50 years ago, being in public, he meant that you know that people are watching me, and that that this is gonna die off. I mean, because at that time nobody had cell phones. Nobody had, you know, any way to kind of
do like the gather the information to the data collection. But in today's world with digital technology there are ways, you know, for people to gather information about us when we are in public. And therefore you know the idea of technology or the you know the the popularization of technology that now it's so popular. Everybody has a cell phone, and you know their cameras everywhere, private and public cameras, I mean in the public setting that changed our behavior already.
So
So sometimes people. They don't realize that they are already kind of equipped. It's almost like when we leave the house in the morning it's almost like our camera. Our public mode
turns on. But that idea of public being public in today's world, it means to be under constant surveillance. It means that you know there is always someone recording us. So so that's why we may believe that doesn't change us. Do I make sense what i'm trying to say Here.
I want people I want. You guys.
Do you feel what I'm saying that you know that to be in public in today's world means to be under surveillance, and therefore you know that may lead you to believe that. No, nothing happens, you know.
So the thing is that it's almost like we. We are much more programmed than we could ever imagine. That's the point.
Anything else to add. I mean, you know i'm i'm speaking here. But I I wish this was like a live. I would see you guys in person, because then you would get. But any anybody wants to, you know, feel free to No, no, not only to chat. But the mic if you, wanna you know, share anything about that, you know.
Okay, you come. You come if you want. So second question, what role does privacy play in our lives?
Let's see what Matthews say that quote who he who who does not move does not notice his change was for yeah. And this, Matthew, I don't know if you got that, because not everybody from either. That comes from
Rosa Luxembourg. So it comes from an author. Those in Paula Science. I know her.
She's her name is Rosa. Okay. She's an European I for about which country she's from. But obviously she died, and she was part of the very early waves of Marxism in Europe.
and but she's actually she's classified in so in science, as a as a as a I like her thoughts are are classified as as political science. Okay. So if you want to read her and she's labeled as an anarchist.
she's excellent. I mean, I. I read a lot about her when I was in my underground. I really like this offer. I find her extremely inspiring, and and you know, and also the fact that she's a woman at that time is, it calls attention, because at that time it was really rare to have. Like. You know, women in the you know, in the unions and labor movements, and you know Marxism, and like left wing movements in Europe. I'm talking about like early did the beginning of the twentieth century. Okay, so just so. You you keep that in mind
if you, if you're curious, you want to know more about her. But I also love that cold, you know.
And and but people here. What role?
Privacy, place?
Why is that important? Why is that significant?
The first thing that comes to mind for me. This is grew speaking about. Why, what what privacy plays and why it's important is my best friend. Just got our identity stolen.
because a while it was stolen, and they have.
She's it's she's constantly now putting out fires of people trying of somebody trying to get credit cards in her name and open up loans and stuff like that. So it's important, I think, not only because it's affecting her
financial.
her financials, and it's. And then it's also affecting her mental.
Of course. Yeah, of course, you know.
I would be like, yeah, I can. I can't. I can't understand that, you know. And and you're right. So you just like what what you're sharing about your friend. I mean it's it's only the future scale. It can compromise your economics, your your economical life, your your mental health, your you know stress levels. I mean, it's just awful. And you're very right, and I think
probably be you know you guys would have more stories about that.
You know, people being impersonated, you know, on the Internet. Stuff like that means just awful right, like. Or you see if we wanna go that far. We can even talk about porn hub, and how a lot of videos they end up in there. And can you imagine I mean, you know, so like, and that's another another whole process. I mean the another whole deal. If you want to take that to help like it, and it's all nearly impossible for people to get videos out of Port Hub and Porn. Hub is everywhere nowhere at the same time, and nobody has money to
file a lawsuit against them. Imagine right so, and imagine if you're a teenager, and then you know the toll on your mental health, it it's even bigger, and so thank you. And and and it was grace right like, Thank you, Grace, and and and indeed.
and and also we can take this question, brother, we can go, even brother, okay, like Macro Mac, or the the example that she said. And I, you know it's an example of a person. But if you think about society people.
we humans like the beauty of being a human is that is your creativity.
Think with me. What is it that makes us humans so unique.
It's our ability to invent our ability to create. That is the most like that's that's what makes it's almost like divine. This ability that we have to create new things, you know, to like to resist, to invent, you know to you know, in that ability is infinite.
right like, and that's what makes our brain so powerful. But the problem is for us to be this amazing creature that we are able to create
things we need a moment. I mean, we need a moment of silence, or we need a moment away, or we need a moment or an environment where we can be ourselves
right so, and and we can truly be who we are, right so.
and a lot of what we are. A lot of our identity has to do with the other. We build our identity, you know it's it's a callative kind of thing, I mean. I I am what I am in relation to you. So right now I am a Prof. Because there is there. Are you guys there, you know, you being the students, so that then we create this relationship, and that makes us be what I am and for you to be student, you need me the pro, so you can be the students. So if there is no pro. You cannot be this student. So anyways, our identity and home
we are is very much tied to to people. So we are social beings in that sense we need people. However, we also need time away, and we need you know that comfort that I mean that there is nobody judging me that there is nobody, because when we are in with others we are like it can be the profit, and be your mother, your parents, your sisters, your brothers, your whoever I mean.
You have roles. When you see people you play a specific role, so we need moments where you know we can just be and be, you know, in in in whatever way that we can be.
and it's almost like it feels that in today's society there is no longer that space, because, you know, like it's the Internet, the Internet of things it took over. And now we just don't have a life anymore that it's kind of
like it's pretty much like, you know. I don't know for you guys. But for me it feels like that all, almost every instance of my life, for every moment of my life
there is Internet, involved, or there is some sort of long
virtual situation happening at the same time. So it's almost like it's very hard now inside, and that's what Glenn is trying to say that I mean for us to be humans. It's almost like we don't have that space anymore. And we see the the problems of that with especially for teenagers, because
teenagers, they tend to be all the time on the Internet on social media platforms, and they are constantly thinking about
what others are are saying and talking and thinking about them. So you know, we see like a lot of like we see. I need a super high, a super big increase in in in the suicide, in in self harming, and and, like you know, all sorts of problems that we didn't have before. And and now we have this almost like super exposure all the time. And and when you are young that really affects your confidence. When you're adult, I mean sometimes it's easier. It might be easier, you know, to deal with.
but when you are young and you are forming your your brains to kind of your identity to building up. And you you have that, you know you never have privacy. Almost so in my do I make sense to you guys, I mean. So i'm trying to kind of, you know.
Steer some like, you know, make you kind of think about this that we need that moment, and if we don't have that moment, it's almost like
we can't be ourselves, and and our drool selves.
and or just you know, be whatever I mean, you know, and in that compromise our creativity, and it is almost takes away our humanity.
and that for society has, you know, a lot of consequences, because, you know, we need we humans. We need society. To live in society requires creativity and like for us to eat better, to do things better. We always need to be creative, even like for us to the advance, the economy.
regardless if it's going to be a capitalist economy, or whatever kind of economy, you know, like human creativity, which is, has always been there. You go in a museum. You go visit a museum, and then you see
all those tools that our ancestors they used to to make in order to cook tweet. And you see oh, my gosh, those guys! They were super smart, I mean, you know. And how do they come up with that? That's that's the human power. And and if we don't have that moment, I mean, how is that? So? That's where he's getting to? You know he's taking that preoccupation
broader, you know, from the individual, obviously just like Gray said. And I said about porn hug, I mean.
But you know, like broader like, you know. So like he and saying, Look, we're gonna create this Society of Zoom. Be where, you know.
you know, we are just like conforming, conforming. There is like, you know, we are not doing anything special or anything deviant like. We are not deviating from the norms or we are not. We're not doing anything that you know that that could be more creative, because you know, we know that you know, if I do this, you know it's gonna be a hassle here. If I do that, I mean.
you know. And sometimes we it's not even conscious. I mean, we just we just duplicate whatever society expects from us.
For me it looks very depressing. I don't know people. Are you guys there?
Because Here's the moment where I I feel like oh, my gosh! This is awkward! I'm talking to the walls.
It kills, it kills Anita.
It kills
it's! It's not so much the Anita. It's not so much to conform it itself.
but it is that frame, that that thing that you that you know it's. It's almost like it's not the the conform it itself that that kills creativity, but it's like you, but like those forces that make you all form, which the like being surveillance being one.
you know, so that
you know, if you are in your i'll give you a very practical example.
Let's suppose you are in your workplace. We're in your office, and you know that everybody is is like is watching. You know that. I mean, you know you know that you are under surveillance, and you don't really have any space to think in your office, and maybe you're not gonna try something that may look stupid.
Maybe you have an idea for something. I mean, you know you have. You want to do something different, and nobody has ever done in your office, in your in your for your employer in your firm, but you feel afraid if you walk, for you don't want to do it, because you know your your co-worker and the look at you, and you're going to say, oh, I need is stupid.
so you know, like you don't take that step. You don't push that edge, you know, because you know, because you're afraid that if things go wrong, people are gonna criticize you right like
when you get to yourself, Why would you want to live life as a lot. Yeah, but that's the point, right? Like what he's trying to say is like Glen is a guy
that this is the the guy who gave the talk. I mean he's pushing. He's pushing against that he's saying, Look we as humanity, we cannot accept a society where you know where we are under surveillance all the time, because
you know, it's taking away our humanity. It's taking away our our desire to live. I mean, because yeah, you might be dead as well you might you might, you, you know, if we cannot be truly humans, why do we live right? I mean, i'm making philosophy here right so why why would we? So that's what he's trying to to get you
So I don't know. I find people that I mean. You know this guy has a point somewhere in there that I mean you know it's. It's it's even like that for the economy. Let's let's think. Let's suppose that we were Bill Gates, or, you know, Mark Zugenberg, or that we were, you know, Eric Schmidt from Schmidt, from Eric Schmidt from Google.
I mean, if we were like some big big capitalist, extremely rich. We would still want. I mean, we we would. Okay. I want people. I want my employees to make money for me.
I need to give them space
because they need to be deviant. They need to be creative, creative. They need to kind of push the envelope, but for them to do that, you know they need some space, and that's why people, large corporations, a lot of them. They even have, like they have a gym for employees, you know they have like, you know you can. You know you can have like a forgotten English, how you guys call there's a name like a breakout, a breakout kind of room where you can go and relax. You know they like some of the kind of more richer companies they give you.
you know, a nice fridge with like, you know, with food, you know, chocolates, I mean. They give you nice foods, you know, like things that, you know. So they try to make you happy. So you know. So you can kind of, you know. And that and and one thing that I really liked about Steve Steve Job.
They got his jobs. I can't remember. His name is Jobs, or whatever the guy Steve Jobs that i'm sure you guys know from from Apple the guy would best.
I I think I mentioned this before, like there is an interview with him that I like a lot
that he discusses. You know, the secret of apple, and he says, Look, the secret of apple is to allow people to be creative, truly creative, to allow them to kind of. I'm gonna try this thing if it doesn't work, and if I lose, if I was some materials, it's fine, you know, like it's like, give people space.
So so, even like, you know, if you are a very smart capitalist, you should kind of keep in mind that I mean
that space is important. I mean, the privacy is important, right? So
so people.
is that okay? Can we move on any comments? Anything you want to jump in and say, feel free to if you want.
hey? We're gonna we're gonna keep moving. So we're gonna move now to the
to this new, You know, to this additional text that we have this text to is a journal article. It is by this guy here called Bennett, and he's a prof at Universal Victoria. And yeah, Grace, this article is actually a thing on the neck.
you know. I'm really happy on the like. I was when I saw, like the the. And I got from Dr. Hackers like oh, man, I don't want to use this, but then I kind of if I did some reflection on my own. Here's like. No, I i'm gonna go. I'm gonna use this because there is a point to be made here.
And then you're gonna get, you know. So I I will guide you. The nice thing is that i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you today where you're going to read for the exam. I'm gonna make you just read like 3 pages of it for the exam. Okay, and in the probably with the contacts that I give to you today, it's going to be more than enough enough. But we're still a Why do you make us read this this thing? Because this guy here
he is the only he's a Canadian scholar, and he is the only scholar who is actually thinking about the governance of privacy.
Okay, so. And that's why he's so important. So that's why you guys need to know. You need to know that this guy exist. You need to know that his ideas are out there, and it's actually obvious. I don't know why it's just academic sometimes. They right so like, you know
they don't write well that's the reality, you know, and it gets bored. So let me break this to you. Okay, so look, we're gonna talk a little bit about the governance of privacy
for those involved. The science might be easier. This this lecture, because I mean, you don't want governance. So we're talking about the way that privacy is regulated the way that we control the way that we guide Privacy Society. Okay, so so there is. There is a governance of privacy out there. So last class last class I gave you guys. We talked a lot about privacy, and how privacy evolved. And I told you. Look, the idea our understanding of privacy changes right.
You change according to culture according to time and space. So you know it's something that keeps changing. But the Government, you know, tries to like, organize, and and govern and regulate privacy.
and that's exactly what we're gonna look at. See how that happens in this text. And when I say privacy here in this text, what I mean by privacy is
personally identifiable information. That's what we're we're gonna we're gonna get more kind of legal today. More kind of you know, like talking about policies. So so he is in his interest. Interested, like Bennett, is interested in understanding how how personally identify when information is protected.
So there is some sort of governance in there for that. So let's understand how this happens, and you're gonna see it's pretty easy. So here some of some ideas for you. Look.
we have like, how do we govern privacy.
We have policies
or
tools of governance. Okay, so, but not like tools of governance, is a nickname for policies is actually a full codeian nickname. Full call, Michel, for the guy that we studied before he used to call policies. He used to refer to policies as tools of governance. Okay, so just like. So this author here he also draws in full call. So that's why he says tools of governance. So look we. We have. Obviously every country
has policies about privacy. Okay, and so that you know. And this. So this is something that you need to keep in mind of. This is obvious. But Don't forget ever that those policies they are tied to culture. They're They're tied to people's understanding of of of privacy. They are tied to, you know, to deal with regulatory traditions, like the way that the country makes policies itself, you know.
and political culture so anyways like. So each
like, you know, each country has its own governance of privacy
like this. Text talks about like
like us, Canada, Europe, European countries, Western Europe. So it's talking about like this part of the world. Okay, so.
And he's interested in understanding how like the technology is changing.
So now we have much more surveillance. Many more certain may many more types of surveillance technologies. So we have all sorts of technologies gathering data from us, and he wants to know how this you know. The transformation of technologies
is changing like the policies around privacy. So it's it's a very simple idea. We have changing technology. How does that change technology influence? You know the policies around privacy. It's very, very, you know. He could have said that like in in one paragraph.
Okay, so. And look one thing that he says, and I I personally agree with him. We, when we are in school people, teach us that policy is something that you know any kind, any piece of policy.
It's very rational, and we tend to perceive policies as rational. When we think about Covid policies, we strongly believe that they were very well thought
right. So. And then, when we go through Covid, we we realize oh, my gosh! Those people who make the policies are being stupid, or what right like, you know, like some policy. Don't make sense, you know, or they contradict each other, or you know, I remember. And now it's all not fresh in my mind anymore. But during Covid here in Canada, like you know, those policies. They don't make any sense like some of them. I was like complaining about the policies I was following them, but I was complaining about them, and saying that that doesn't make any sense. I am an immigrant in Canada. I can. I could name to you like me.
No like. I'll share with you right now. I got my
permanent residents in Canada, meaning that now I am a permanent resident of the country, and I am waiting for them to send my my card because of, like, you know, like when you are a resident of the country, you got a card that you know there's an identity. And look at this. The policy says that you know that that
I have to wait for my card, and I cannot leave the country.
So let's suppose I have a business meeting in the United States. I cannot leave. I cannot go, so. The policy, like you know, interf. And because in in Canada there's like, you know, if you guys know about passports and everything, there's huge delays for passports for any kind of Id you know, like or most kinds of, Id like passport being one. So for you guys, if you're a Canadian, you're gonna get a passport. It's gonna take you 6 months. I don't know it's even more and
and the same for my card. It's gonna take 6 months to arrive, so it's like.
and I cannot leave the country. I mean, this is an absurd. Let's suppose that someone in my family dies right so, and I have to go back. I mean you get you get the points I'm just giving you. We don't you think of policy as something very oh, no, i'm sure that there is some rationality. No, Bs: I mean surprise surprise. Nothing works right like. So I mean, yeah, we could talk about policy, you know. But the same, the same goes for privacy policies, I mean. They look so good on paper. In their reality. They don't quite work, you know, so that's kind of get ready for
for that. So look one more thing here, people. So, Paul: okay. So, Paul. Oh, my gosh, they are not rational. Yes, they are not, you know, and we tend to think that they work so and and look. They are very contact. They are. They are impacted. Policies are influenced by like
context, specific constraints. In my case me waiting for my Id card, you know, like I I actually emailed the government, and I got a reply today, and they told me. Oh, i'm so sorry. No about you whatever, you know. But you know there's nothing we can do. You have to wait. It's just because we don't have enough menpower for like for crisis. Just hire more people and print those cards quicker. But anyways, whatever there's some constraints in there right like like styles like government government governing styles. I mean this style.
you know. Who Whoever is running the bureaucracy also.
like policies, are very much influenced by by the legacy within the bureaucracy, like, you know, like which it's kind of a little bit of style. True, it's mixed with style, not quite style, but, like you know, things have always been done that way, and then, therefore, they keep doing things in that way. I mean again.
just to talk about passport, I mean. Canada could very easily just bring more passports, and you know, and get all the Canadians outside of the like. You know people are lining up for for months. I mean that's an absurd. But again, you know. Oh, we have. We have always done that way. So we're gonna keep doing that way and politics I mean a lot of the policies they have to with politics. I I shared with you guys that i'm doing research in prison right now, and I can't. I could. I could stay here. They could talk the whole day about policies
that you know that they look very nice on paper, but in reality they don't work. So, For example, i'll give you just one example the solitary confinement policy. Now we have a new policy in Canada that we have a you know we we Don't have solitary confinement anymore. What we have is like, it's like we confine deep in a specific area, and they can. It's not really solitary anymore. Anyways, I won't give you what today is but like. But the point is
when they made that policy they forgot that about 30 of the people who who go to solitary in Canada, you know, like people who are in prison, and then they are transferred to solitary. They are people
who actually, they ask to go because they are receiving threats
in the main population. So let's suppose you are a prisoner. You owe some money. Someone wants to kill you because you have a debt. So you go to a correctional officer and say, Look, I want to please, just like I. I am in danger. There's risks. Just put me away for a few days until things they
chew out, and then I can come back. So 30 30% of all the people who go to solitary. It's just this kind of situation, and the policy now is that in a way that people inside of the solitary they mixed up.
So so if I get this person, and I put this person solitaire for their own protection. They might be mixing up with another image in there that actually friends with the guy who you know who who he owes money to, and that guy could stab him so it's like, i'm just give you an example like you know people make policies. They don't understand their reality, and you know, and and things just backfire very, very badly. But they look amazing on paper, because, look, oh, you know the new polls. It says that Canada no longer has
solitary confinement. Isn't that beautiful. It is beautiful on paper, but in reality people are getting killed. So you you right? So, anyways look back to privacy here. Why, you know
why you know why this offer Bennett is interested in exploring policy changes
in regards to technology, because obviously there is massive amount of surveillance happening right now. There is massive amount of of personally identifiable information being gathered from us all the time. There is a huge advance advance advancement in media social media. So it's like it's just huge right? So so that's that's pretty much the point, so he wants to understand.
Is this changing the the
policy landscaping
landscape? It is okay. So look i'll get you the chat in a second.
But we we, we have it. We have one, or we have quite a few minutes. Okay. So look.
The point is here we do have before we talk about the policies, and I would like to highlight some policies for you.
I would like to for you to keep in mind. There is a paradigm paradigm this word in English and use model. There is a framework. There is a paradigm for the governance of privacy. When you think about how we society should govern privacy.
Oh, I just saw that knowledge is and spelled here. But, like you, got to think about 2 things, 2 principles. The first one is knowledge.
So when we're going to govern people's privacy.
we need
to do it in a way that that
people are aware they are knowledgeable about their data, and they are knowledgeable. They have the knowledge that their data is being collected. So it's almost like this: the framework that we have. Now it. It's based on those those 2 assumptions.
One is that we need to form people and take note of that 2 assumptions. Okay. The the paradigm for governance in today's world is based on the assumption that we need to tell people. Look, your data is being gathered.
So you need to know this, and that's why, when you do anything on Internet, they are or anything anywhere, they any kind of service they ask you, do you consent? And quite often we don't read right like those small letters about the consent part, and we just say, yes, we just tick the box, and and that's a problem, by the way, right like in in, in in firms and enterprise corporations. They take advantage of that. They know that we don't read, and they take advantage, and they put stuff in there that later.
you know, we can't avoid right. So.
And the idea of consent so so that we have to consent to give up, give out our data. So those 2, those 2 ideas, knowledge and consent. And please fix. I'm going to fix on this slide. This is spelling here.
is it? No, it's right. I think it's right. Yeah. Knowledge. Yeah, it's right. So like, you know. So those 2 ideas, it's really important. So all the entire in most Western countries. The governance of privacy is based on those 2 assumptions, knowledge and consent. Okay, that doesn't make any good, because I mean, sometimes again, people just like you know that you
you don't really have the knowledge, or you know you just tick the box right? So
so, people, when we think about the governance of privacy we have to think about. We talked about the assumption, the driving assumption. And now we're going to think about the agencies and actors issuing legislation.
So we have a bunch of legislation around privacy. So, and we have actors and agencies. It's usually government that issues that legislation. And then so we, if you're going to steady privacy and privacy law. You have to be mindful of that. Okay, who is the agency here? Right? So. And then also you you got to think about like not only the legislation, but you gotta think about the agencies and actors is showing this standard
standards, because, look you have a legislation. The legislation says Marcella needs you can only Co. You can only collect, you know, you know, identify, identify the information from our Sal. If she is with that. Okay, great.
But you need a standard. How do you know if I agree or I do not agree?
So you you know we need to create standards. And in, for example, that little
tick box that we sign. That's the standard, I mean, and and it's. But it's not by chance that you know those consent agreements. They look the same in every kind of service that we get, because there is some standards behind that right so overall. But those standards. They don't work. Yeah, I agree. But but you know, but that's we need to fix them.
We also need about. We also need to think about the authorities enforcing enforcing the legislation and standards. It's almost like the same way that we have the police to, you know, to reinforce things. We need some sort of privacy police that enforces, you know, like you know, the legislation and the standards, because there's no good if you have laws, but nobody follows the law, and nothing happens to people who break the law. Right? So so that's why. But and I can tell you right now that
the last boxing here the authorities in forcing legislation.
We it's. This is like it's like
we are not we a society? We are not doing a good job in there. Okay.
another thing that we let's. Let's just case now. We know those 3 things that we got to think about. You know the legislation, the standards and the enforcement. But before, let me just go in the chat here so I can see you guys.
So we talked about this in community service like, yeah, okay, yeah, how people often in power do not understand or have experience exactly people because look, Lucy, you are so right. I mean, look at the language. Think about the standards that we like those
like agreements that we sign, especially like with, like, you know, like service over the Internet, that there's nobody there to explain to us what that means.
and and you know it's the we we. If we don't check the box, we the the page, cannot move ahead, and Sometimes we are in a hurry because we're gonna buy something, and we just like, skip that part right? We just say check and go, and so, but that I mean, you know. I mean, if you are the more education you have.
you know, and usually education is a is is to your socioeconomic status to your parents and everything I mean, the more education you have, the more you're going to take the time to actually read that stuff, or the more education you have. You're going to have the ability to scheme read. You're going to read Super fast.
you're gonna, you know. So for you, who have a lot of location who go to the U. Of a, who had parents who had, you know, like degrees, and the parents went to the University, and you, who had, like, you know, all sorts of resource for you is going to be much easier, you know, to kind of navigate that landscape. But if someone who, you know.
who doesn't really know. It's kind of, you know, functional like the the person it's almost like literate, I mean, like like, technically speaking, the person cannot really comprehend. I mean it's it's much harder, right? So, and that ties back to social economics to schooling. I mean to opportunities in life. So
So your comments really really good, you know
Exactly. You know that's exactly that there is now. Okay. So there's that, that, you you know, like artificial intelligence. That kind of Matthew is talking about here that you know it gives you just the unusual stuff. Yeah, but the thing is that even that, Matthew.
for you to break that language down, I mean, because sometimes we read, we understand. But we don't know what that means, right, so even that the artificial intelligence they might flag stuff to you, but might not, you know, but again requires you having some knowledge of this subject matter.
Yeah, exactly. And and Anita, i'm not surprised to hear that, because again, just like I told you guys, this the forcing side is just awful.
We don't really have any kind of enforcement. Let's suppose that you know that your data was sold.
I mean what you're gonna do. Do you have the money to access the justice system to to file a lawsuit. How much that's gonna cost you? I don't. I don't have the money If I know that you know that I mean my data is somewhere. I'm, i'm, I'm done lost. I'm gonna. Of course I will try to use all the resources, but very likely I won't have the money to access the the justice system.
you know. So that means in the end. I'm going to be, you know.
I mean travel right like i'm screwed to
to to try to use. You know what cursing. So
yeah, exactly, Jessica. You're very right, you know.
Yeah. So look here, people. So I would like you to keep this, I mean, do do you have to memorize that? No, you do not. But i'd like you to know. I mean, you're not gonna ask the specific thing in a specific thing like this in the exam. But i'd like you to know
that those agencies that you see in front of you here they cancel of Europe.
O, we Cg: EU: okay.
Like the Apec Asian Pacific Corpor Corporation, the Wto: Those are the biggest agencies issuing privacy loss.
Okay.
So and I. Why do I have this little mark on the European Union? Because the European Union has this
huge body of legislation called general data protection regulation? That is the most advanced.
They data protection legislation in the world. Canada now is trying to catch up with Europe and Canada is trying to mimic what's happening in Europe. We're going to talk about that. But the point is why Canada wants to get on board with whatever is happening in Europe. First, because there is social movements, human rights, movements pressurize in Canada to do that in the internal movements. Second, because if Canada has the same kind of template legislation as
Europe. It's easier for business because think about business in today world.
Of course, a lot of it is like
like pro, like a products like things that we buy
and import, but a lot of the business into the world into this world. It has to be like, you know, research and development. It has to do with, like, you know, knowledge being transferred, I mean, you know, consulting companies. So like, if you have that kind of, or or data being sold and being exchanged. So you know. So if you have that agreement, if if your country has the same template as 0
and Europe being the most advanced legislation. It's easier for your country to make business with Europe. That's that's the whole drive behind it's money, people, you know. So I also like to say to you that courts
like like for it in Canada, in European countries and elsewhere. They also play a major role in regulating privacy. Okay, so i'll give you one example here that comes from Spain. So in Spain 2,014 Google lost
a lawsuit to a guy.
this guy like this guy he had a building.
He had the building that had some that okay, and I can't remember exactly the details of the store, because I never read the court case I I did. I follow that on the media. But this guy, you know he had the building and the building had that, and then the the the building what went on a forced kind of auction
like the Government force the guy to sell the building so the Government could, you know, get paid back which normal, normal kind of circumstance that happens all the time every day in every country but this guy. So this the problem was every time. That's someone who type his name. This guy's name on the Internet immediately
that, like you know what you'd find was not his Facebook page or his linketing. It would be this like building story like this story about the building and the option and blah blah blah. So he he filed a a a suit against Google, you know, and requesting Google to remove. That's like that. That that search, you know. Take that away from that information from search, because he was saying, come on. You know
that doesn't make any sense. That part of my life is solved. The building is not even here anymore, you know, I mean. But like. You know, the first thing that people hear about me is this bad story right? So so he actually won his court case, and that court case became very, very famous.
It's the right to be forgotten. I'm sure some of you might have heard about that. Have you ever heard about this right to be forgotten
that you actually have the yeah. So some of you yeah. So people, just for your knowledge, you actually do have the right.
you know, to request. You know, any kind of search engine, including Google, to remove information from you information that is inadequate information that is irrelevant, or that it's no longer relevant, you know, because too much time has passed.
So so we all we have this, you know, thanks to you know. And after losing this court case, Google created, you know, like
a channel for you to actually report. You know something that you want to be taken away from the Internet. I've seen news article about people complain that that that doesn't quite work again. It goes back to
Enforcement. There is nobody forcing that right so but but anyways, but that I mean, this is just an example of how court cases they actually they actually advance the legislation in regard to privacy.
Okay, another topic here. Let's see how much time I have. Okay, 5 min Look, we talked about here, so we are dissecting those 3, or, if not by dissecting. But I kind of go going over. So you understand where we're coming from. So let's talk about the standards now. So in terms of standards again.
just to say, oh, you have the right to be forgotten. That's not enough. We actually need a protocol. We need a standard for that to happen right? So I mean for sure, Google my having there some sort of standard
that you know that internal standard. You know that they follow, however, those standards there, not only for internal things. They are for societal things, too. So we need standard. So
who are the organizations is showing standards for a, for for, for for for for for for for, for, for for for for for for the regulation of privacy. It is the I. S. O.
I saw also known as Iso.
Probably if I have, I don't know if I have anybody here in sciences but people in sciences you might have heard of I so 9,000, I so 2,000, I so 8,000. Those are standards, for you know they have like quality assurance standards, I mean, I so produce a lot of standards for quality assurance.
European Committee for a standard standardization, European Telecommunications Standards Institute Institute of Electrical Electronics, Engineers standards, I mean. So I mean, this is like, just so, you have an idea. But how about Canada? We are just starting people. We are really behind, really, really behind. Okay.
Another thing that I would like to to talk to you on those 3 is like the idea of all like whoever is doing this enforcement here right like the enforcement part. So you, when when you're gonna study privacy laws. You gotta think about that. So
we actually call the people enforcing. We call them data protection forages. So it's like Dpa. So we need to think of. Who is the Dpa? Is there a Dpa? Because if there is a Dpa, if there is no Dpa, nobody is gonna actually, you know, respect. Right? So so what kind of role do they play? They are kind of on woodsman.
They are kind of auditors there. They play the role of consultant educators a lot of their their jobs. Education is to tell us our rights right? So
negotiate policies and device policies enforce laws in Canada in the Federal level. The office of the Privacy Commissioner is the Dpa.
In the provincial level in each province we have one kind of Dpa in Alberta is the office of the Information Privacy Commissioner. Okay. So just you. You have an idea, because I want you to think about this structure. To think about privacy and privacy. Loss is to think about the legislation.
Who Whoever is, is showing that legislation to think about the standards and to think about the Pdas, which is the authority forcing. So I want you to keep this in mind. If you ever decide to do a capstone and honors, These is where a masters, or if you ever decide to take like, you know, kind of this business of privacy more seriously like meaning, take it to grad school or to research, or if you're gonna work with that, you need to kind of have this in your mind. Okay.
let's see here. Oh, I have one more minutes. So i'm going to stop you here, people.
and here those are the pages that i'd like you to kind of
focus on for the exam.
you know, because I I know that the whole the art was really dry, you know. But you know, and then I I I will finish my lecture. I'm gonna pre record a lecture for you, and then i'm gonna actually cover. You know the legislation in Canada, and then we can talk about that later. I also will try to do my pre record pre recorded lecture. I'll go back to a few slides from last class that I wanna highlight for you.
I think that's that's it for today, because my time is up. I'm sorry, people. I was a little bit in a hurry here, but stay on the line if you have questions, or if you want to share anything, or if you have any concerns or anything for now, thank you very much. You guys have a great afternoon. Take care of yourselves, your physical and mental health. Okay.
take care of you and that oh, and I have off hours if you need me today. So
Thank you. People take care. Okay.
Hello.
I mean, just let me just stop the recording thing here. So I don't want to record your question. So.
