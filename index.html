"Hey, folks! Hello, everybody! Welcome to our
course on surveillance. First of all, this is the first time that i'm using the setup. Do you hear me? Do you see me?
I am going to try to change the slides, because you know i'm not very. I don't think i'm very clear in there. But
yeah, okay, you're okay, good.
So i'm happy to report that I am in Edmonton. So after over a year.
So it's it's it feels really good to come back home.
and I also like to apologize last. I couldn't. I couldn't do last class, either in person or to record it, because I was traveling, and it was too crazy, you know. But it's okay. I kind of predicted that. So if you go to our syllabus, you're gonna see that.
you know. Today we were supposed to be discussing a full call, Michelle, for call, and next week we are our next class. On on Thursday we we are supposed to be discussing Delus, which is a French philosopher. Very good friends of with full call, by the way, and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna combine.
You know. I gave like one lecture for each, but i'm gonna combine them. And you're gonna say it's pretty fine, because, like the news is full calls. Reading is a bit heavy, but i'm going to break it down for you. But like this is reading is also heavy, but it's very short. So you know it's it's doable. So you know
it. It Won't really impact us. Okay. So
so first, do you? I? I would like to kind of give you a heads up.
I've I've been getting a lot of emails of people, Marcella. Where do I find the password to watch the lecture?
I would like you guys to share in the chat. Where do you find the password? Because, like on my end.
I put a link
to the lecture on our class, and then like on the title of the lecture. I put the password. But like, are you guys using that, or you're or you're getting the password somehow through.
Okay. So so, Valencia, she says, it's okay. So you're getting to tie. Okay. So you're you're going by the title. Okay, that's fine. So. That's what i'm telling. People just read the title. You're gonna see that there is a password in there, you know I I wasn't I was. I was. I wasn't sure if you could actually find the password.
you know, on somewhere I don't know, like inside of zoom, or your zoom account, I don't know.
Okay, that's fine. Okay, so this is good. Thank you guys very much for sharing that. So okay, okay. So this is, I think this is this, is it. There's one classmate of yours
This person shared with me a very nice Ted Talk which covers I didn't. I didn't watch the whole Ted talk Yet I I start watching, but it just like Pause me the way i'm gonna finish tonight. But it's a nice set talk that talks about. You know the the take home messages from last week.
Our tools from just get here next week.
So here, if you remember well.
we have.
See where that is.
Just get my slides. It's just easier
within a second. Hold on a second, please.
If you go to the end of my slides last week. Okay, the end of them. So what we have in there is.
Let's see where that is.
I asked you to read
lessons. Okay, so
no, no, not that. Hold on a second.
or is it
okay? Here it's like, If you go to my last week's presentation slide set slide 28.
You're gonna seen there. The 10 big ideas. Obviously you can play that again. But the Ted Talk discusses some of those ideas, you know. So it's it's interesting for us to think further, but i'll share with you. I'll put on on the class for you. It's not for exam, or none of that is just in case you want to kind of think a deeper about surveillance. Okay.
So
also I would like to let you know, in case you have some nice materials that you want to share with me and your classmates.
Just send it. Send them away, because, you know there's there's a lot of materials today about surveillance. So if if there's anything that Co. Catches your eye, and you kind of all this is really interesting. Please share with me, and then i'll share for everybody else.
And or if if you don't want to share for everybody else, just let me know ourselves. This is just for you, you know, whatever that is, just share, I mean because there's a lot of nice resources.
Okay, so do you have any questions anything that you were concerned about? Please let me know here before I start, and then we're gonna jump right into the text.
Okay, let me just as you think. Let me just share my slides with you. I'm going to post them
as soon as we are done.
because sometimes I make little edits about so as we are done here
I am gonna
I'm gonna i'm gonna post up to you.
Let me know.
Oh.
do you see me or no
people?
Okay, do you see? Like okay, Great can? Do you see the full screen like the big screen, or, you see, because right now I just have to. I don't know. For some reason I have 2 screens. Do you just see my screen, or you see me, or what do you see? Exactly.
Okay.
Just try to share this. I'm gonna share, because something went for only here
because we're supposed to see my slides, and then me
right like i'll decide
20 funny
new set up new life, so it's kind of things are a little bit so weird to your my end.
Hey? Do you see me now? And okay, you you you guys tell me if you don't see my slides.
Do you see?
Sorry, I just will bug you one more time. But you you're supposed to see my screen in my face. You're not supposed to see my notes, although I don't have any notes. But, like you're not supposed to see my notes. Is that what you've seen there? My screen in my face?
Okay, great. So we are all good to go right like. Okay. So let's go, then.
Okay. So that's so. The way
Dr. Haggardy and I the way that we organize. This course is
first. We have this intro for you, which I gave last week, right like. So, being through kind of just to kind of get you going just to kind of make you think about surveillance. So we came. We met. We discussed a syllabus. Then I gave you a like I'm. Through the introductory kind of lecture. And so today, what I am going to give you is is some the main purpose today. The main the main goal of today's lecturer. Please take note of that. The main goal of today's lecture is for you to kind of
walk away from here with some elements for you to start to theorize surveillance. Okay, so just like basic elements for you to start kind of all this type of surveillance is this type there? This other kind is another kind. So it's almost like you being able to differentiate
different types of surveillance. And before we go
to this like and start this lecture I would like to remind you of something very important. You got to remind surveillance about data collection is about monitoring, but you also want to remember you know, like the my pre-recorded for you. That surveillance is also about governance. When you do surveillance on someone or something, you do it because you are trying to govern someone's or something's life. So you're trying to govern behavior outwardly. That's why we do surveillance.
and that's why there's a lot of people in both science here, because it's about like. If you want to understand governance.
you've got to think about how data is collected, how how we classify populations. It can be populations of people or animals, or whatever. How we classify things as society, how we govern, how we use those classifications to govern the way that people behave. Okay. So if you have any comments, I I have the chat here right in front of me, you know.
Yeah, just put on the chat balance. At least, if you have a question, just throw in there. I'm gonna i'm gonna keep i'm gonna keep checking the chat, you know. So you know, just putting there. Okay, so and also feel free to kind. If you guys see that i'm kind of switching gears
and and you know, when I didn't see the chat to say myself, Chat, please, you know. And then I checked the check, because sometimes I may forget. Okay. So again. So remember this, I beg you you have to keep that in mind, because if you don't keep that in mind, that surveillance is about governance that ultimately the purpose of surveillance is to govern on a very micro level.
It can be me and you or it can be me and the entire class, or it can be me in the country, or it can be me and all the clients, the consumers. I mean, it's about to offer. So keep this in mind. Okay, yeah. Some. You post the slides. Jenn: yeah, Thank you for your question right after. Why, I don't. I'm gonna actually
I should start doing it first of before class. The only fear that I have is that sometimes I do. I make little change. I find some little titles or someone makes a comment, and I I bet that in this line, and then, you know, let's here. Let's let's make a deal. Always start posting these lines before.
but then be aware that sometimes I do make some little notes to them. If you are in class you're gonna see me doing it. Oh, you know, because I say, if you watch classes say, oh, i'm gonna change this here. I'm gonna add this in here, but that's the only reason why I don't put before. But I understand it's easier for you guys if I put it earlier like, so you can have this line. You can type on it right. So i'm gonna start to do that.
anyway. So you're ready. So let's so. Oh, yeah. So before. So so here's just some very preliminary elements for you to kind of understand surveillance and and start to kind of differentiate different kinds of surveillance, and therefore different kinds of governance. Okay, and we are going to. We are going to start with the literature.
This is what I'm giving you today where it's the that they have readings that we're discussing today. They are not sociology or science or scientific. They are a literature. They are novels. So
look, we are going to start. I don't know why it's not
okay, not here. We go. So we're going to discuss George Orals fragments. We're going to discuss on those Huxley fragments, and we're going to discuss an interview with others. Huxley, Marcella, what the heck is this look. George world is a very fables novelist
for his Dystopian novel called 1984. Okay, so he was. The he was a writer of 1984, so I can't find. Yeah, it's not. It's not in there yet.
I but I like starting from next week I will put the slides in there for you. Okay, but it's not in there yet. So but so we're gonna discuss Jordan Laurel and a little bit of 1984.
I will like those Huxley.
I probably a lot of you. Probably most have you ever heard of those of of of George World in in 1984
just a show of hands in the chat. Yes, yes, Nope. Just just put in there. Yes. Nope. Nope. Yes, No. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of very popular, is if you Haven't heard. This is actually nice that you Haven't heard, because you're gonna hear. Now you're gonna go like. Oh, my gosh! This is interesting.
So this is a novel. I highly recommend you guys to read it. Okay, yeah, that's nice. You read like very brick 12. I highly recommend. I read this: I was very young. I was 14 or 15 to, you know, like the same age of some of you.
And but have you heard of those Huxley and his book.
The Brave New World. Let's see who did.
Yep. Yep. I believe that would be more nose. Let's see. Someone know. Yes, no. Okay. I see more those and that's exactly yeah, okay. You heard some people heard No, it's. It's so funny, because when we think about surveillance immediately week, it comes 1984. The book
and the big brother, the the big brother is the name is is the is is is a reference in the book 1984, and it is a synonym for the State.
So the State called Big Brother. Okay. So when I think surveillance we think Big brother we think 1,984. And interestingly, we don't think about adults, Huxley
people never but I mean even for me at the U. Of a. It took forever for me, I mean I always knew the book. I read the book also when I was very in the brave New World, the book by Huxley, and I remember me like many years ago, asking Dr. Hegery, my supervisor, like, Why, the heck you don't talk about
Huxley.
Because for me, Marcella
Huxley's book, the brave new world. It's much more interesting
for people who are interested in surveillance, and I asked him, Why, don't you talk about it? Because you know for me it's much more subtle, you know. It is exactly the the kind of surveillance that we have today society, and then he was like. Oh, I don't know it's just because the other one is more famous. People connect better, which is right, I mean, but this one for me it gives us
much more out, many more element or much more elements to think surveillance in our society today. Okay. So we're going to talk about a little bit about them, and then we're going to see an interview with on those Huxley. So let's go.
And again, so today it's just literature trying to get you kind of you know, like you're gonna like inspired. Okay. So just put some cover for you for those of you who never, you know, read the book or never heard about the book 1984, by George Will. Oh, Jordan World, One thing.
Look at this. This book. Here was published in 1949. Okay, 1984 was actually published in 1,949. Do you know is there any historical event that comes to mind? 1949?
Anything? Let's see the chat. Anything any historical event that rings the bell for 19, not 84, but 1,949. The data that the book was published.
Come on, people. Anybody here who has been to China or visit China. People in both science, who you know, steady Communist countries. I mean anything, rings the bell.
No, no, matthew it's not that the rise, the the the curtain. It was 89. Okay, the the the end of the carton was 89, so not that in 991 Republic of China. Oh, oh, someone, we just said Republic of Chinese, but it's not the Republic of China, it is the people
people's Republic of China.
So it is the Communist River, the end of the Communist revolution in China. Keep this in mind, not because I am interested in China, as you guys know by now, but because you're gonna see. I'm gonna draw a lot of comparisons with China, but not because of my interest, but because, you know, like, though that was kind of inspiring George Laurel. Okay.
Also, I should tell you that I should tell you that Jard War. Actually.
he was the student of adults, Huxley.
and it's so funny. So you know, AD those Hxley was a professor of of George Rural and and and the Brave New World. The other book that we're going to discuss. It came earlier. It came in 1932,
and it is, in my opinion it's much more sophisticated.
So it's so funny because we usually I expect my students to be better than that than what I am. I expect you guys to do better than what I do, and in in, you know, and to surpass me, and and to write better sociology and premiology and surveillance studies. But in that case here was the opposite, you know, like ironically, George Warren became much more famous.
You know he is the famous guy just turned his off. He is a famous guy, however, you know his like the students, is the famous, but in my opinion the prof is better. You know this shouldn't never surpass the pros. But anyways, let's let's keep going. So this is the the cover. Here's some context for you.
and feel free to add stuff on the chat. And and just so you know it's it's the end of the Civil War, which is the Co. Which was the Communist revolutions at the end in China. But anyways back to the book here.
So the the whole story is the story of Winston Smith, I mean. Well, he's the main character. He's the main character. Okay. And this guy. The the whole context is London. Okay?
And those 2 guys they were British, both George War and and also those Huxley. So they were British people. So like this this is, it happens in London and the name of the country it's called
so, I think, in English. As to or yeah, we'll see any Portuguese in English and that country that place, that that that society where I Smith, lived. It's always at war.
and and the party, the government. The State is the big brother. Okay. So in the like this, this this slogan here for this society is war is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
Think about this. Think about this slogan, I mean, how do you? How is that possible to reconcile warriors? Peace and freedom and slavery? Is slavery and ignorance is strength. I mean.
don't you guys find this weird, and and if you do find a weird kind of it that those things don't pair together right? There is a contradiction in here, and and that that contradiction it was part of the entire like, like the entire regime in which a sense, in in the sense that I mean things. They were contradictory
and and but they state, managed to say, No, no, this is what it is. This is what you See, there's no contradiction here. What you see is just, you know it's just conformity. It's all. It's all good. It's all. There's no there is no problem in here, and and
we're gonna talk more about that when we talk about the language. Okay. But keep in mind. You know this this slogan, also the political regime in this book was called
in Sock, which stands for English Socialism.
so like that society was a Socialist side. So we have George War trying to, you know, deep pipe, or or portray a Socialist society where we had a big, broader, very similar to China. You see. Like to. You know what how we see China here in the West. Okay, in terms of language.
that society had a new, entire new language which was called Neil Speak. Okay. So the assumption behind.
like this new society, where, you know, was a Socialist society, you know, that was called Oceania, and had that slogan, and and it had a new entire new dictionary, that the whole assumption was that for awards they do have power, and probably
you would agree with me, and that's why we we even in today's society we keep changing
words cause words they are molded. So let's let's think about racism. For example, there's an all a lot of words that we don't use them anymore, and they are considered like, like extremely like they're supposed to. They're considered like a
insulting and disrespectful. I mean, you know in in in the whole, you know, domain of racism, or even like other words like
you know, like, for example, we now have the word Lgbtq 2 plus a so it's a new, a new word for you know, for a new category of of gender and and sexuality. So so we keep changing that. Okay, but like in the but so why? I'm saying that because words they do have power
right? So words they cost you 5 people, so that government. So look, remember, surveillance is about data. Collection is about monitoring. So for you to monitor someone a very good way of monitoring someone's calling someone a name right? So even they can today society. So back to they changed the, to to the language, because they, you know, they create their whole new. They they created new speak or an entire new dictionary, because
these okay words, they have power. We want to take control of, of, of of society by controlling words that can and cannot be used right. So so, for example.
I don't know if you can see you cannot see my My, no. I left some notes for you some examples. Crime stopped crime stock.
you know. The meaning of that was not to stop crime or stop criminality, but was to kind of get read of any, get read of any thought that was wrong that was not in compliance with whatever the big, broader wanted you to think so. That was crime. Stop, so that you you're having this bad thoughts. What are bad thoughts thoughts that are not in compliance. And then you kind of make them go away, that making them go away. What's called crime stock.
So you had, for example, crime, think crime, think, was exactly to you. Think things that the party did not want you to think right. So double think double thing was to have, like, you know, to think.
contract like thoughts that they were con contradictory. They were like, you know they were in a position, and and they were true at the same time which it is the case. The case of that slogan. War is peace, and freedom is slavery, I mean.
I see a huge contradiction. War cannot be peace, and vice versa. Freedom cannot be slavery, and vice versa. Ignorance cannot be strength, and vice versa, but like but the parts I don't know
those things there they are the truth.
So like this idea of having contradictory kind of thoughts that they actually are true. There was a name for that that that was called double. Think. Okay. So when you're double, like just double think meaning, you know. Just go tag along with that, you know.
They also called the normal English olds pick.
so old speak, was just a normal English sex crime was any kind of sexual act that was done without the notation of procreation. So in this society sex was meant for pro procreation. And why was that? Because.
you know the party? They did not want people to have personal feelings like any kind of like personal, any kind of emotions
had to be regulated by the party. So if you're gonna hate you're gonna hate someone at the party told you to hate if you're gonna law, if you're gonna love someone that the party told you to to love so like, you know, it's so. Having sex.
you know, just for the sake of having sex that meant unregulated kind of emotions, so that what there was, you know, that was monitored, and data was collect on that on that.
and people were punished. Okay, so just kind of give you, you know. So the main character is this guy named Smith and Winston Smith, and he was an employee of the government. So he worked for the the Ministry of of Truth.
which was also called Mini. True. Okay, in in this, like New speak new speak was mean, true. So he worked for me, it true, and he was deviant. He was a deviant character. Why? Because he kept a diary.
which was something that the party did not allow. Because think with me when you were when you were keeping a diary. People
I don't know if I don't, if you ever. I mean I I have never had a diary. I mean, that's not really part of the Brazilian culture, but I know that here in Canada a lot of the kids and teenagers, and even adults. They're encouraged to kind of. You know you You keep. You have that habit.
and and but to keep a diary. That means that you are producing. You are collecting data on society. You are collecting data on your own life, and you're recording that data, and that
in Oceania only the State had the power to do so. You are not allowed to, you know, to produce your own records, to collect data about society, I mean, that was something that so? That was deviant. So he kept a drop diary. And and also
another thing was that you know he had. I mean, this is not in the the parts that I gave you. But like, if you read the book or watch the movie, you're gonna see that he falls in love with someone which is also not supposed to happen. So he was a very deviant character in the same, in the sense that he was broken the norms he was broken. The loss and he in his job was his job at the Ministry of Truth
was pretty much to edit information.
So we're gonna discuss them more, you know. But so far am I making sense to you? Because I mean, this is a dystopian. I'm trying to kind of give you context of a dystopian society that we're society where surveillance was strong. I mean, does it? It makes sense? I'm. Here in the chat, just checking. If you, if you guys are following okay, would you like to add anything so far?
You know anything that you know that for those of you who read, or those of you read like the book or the excerpts, or, you know, would like to add anything, feel free to do so. Okay, like.
So
look another thing. So let's let's go here. And okay, let's let's think about
the type of surveillance that take the type of data collection monitoring the type of governance that was common in that society of 1984. So when we think about, when we think about visibility
in terms of surveillance, if surveillance is the governance. Think about it! What? All those for us boxes that you see, they speak back to the type of surveillance, the type of data collection monitoring governance, so go like like like like like
governance in that society of 1,984
it was extremely visible, extremely visible. So all the time, you know you had like the big broader like you. Let's suppose you are working. I'm here teaching right now. I'm teaching you guys.
And then, all of a sudden the speaker there was a speaker somewhere here in the room, and this speaker would go like You know, Marcella, what your say is not quite like that, or you said something that should be corrected. I mean so. The big brother would interfere in my life or in your life in any kind of context could be that be private or public.
you know, because the big brother was this entity that had this.
like, you know, presence everywhere, and that that big brother would be true in your life, and tell you, you know, and tell you to apply yourself, or to you know, to rephrase what you just did so like what I just said. So surveillance. So take note of that surveillance. Governance monitoring was extremely, extremely extremely visible.
Okay, and yet you could say all. But the big brother was everywhere. Yeah, it was everywhere, but it made itself visible through by intruding in people's life all of a sudden. Let's suppose you in the book there are, like many, many situations where Smith is doing something like, you know.
like something like very from the daily life.
and that's that. I mean, I'm gonna make up something here like, you know you're cooking eggs, and then the big brother tells you you're not supposed to cook at this that way. You're supposed to do that in that I mean. So you know
so, and and and also surveillance
was, or you know, that book is external.
So there is this entity.
the big broader, you know, doing surveillance on you. So this entity doing surveillance on its subjects. We are the subjects. Smith is a subject, so so remember it's visible.
It's external Marcella what you're talking about. Surveillance surveillance is visible. Surveillance is external okay.
monitoring the monitoring that happens in that society which is
like one aspect of surveillance.
was forceful. It was extremely coerative. So if you don't do what I say, I catch you doing something wrong, and if you don't apply yourself, you are punished.
So people disappear. Anyone who does anything wrong, just the anyone that challenges the th the big broader the State disappears right, so that it's based on terror. So people are terrified, so that's pretty much the kind of monitoring that we have any kind of individuality
like any. Oh, I like this, or I prefer that that was banned.
You don't like anything. You don't prefer anything. You go with the the mess that the masses like the people, the population you do, whatever the Government tells you to do right, you go with everybody so.
and in terms of got. When we think strictly about like the way that the governance was done, was the and and also the surveillance through conflict. So there is always a figure of a position.
Okay, always a figure of a position. So an enemy that we have to kill an enemy that we have to. We go to war against, and then I mean that they could be the neighbor, someone who is there's always an enemy. The idea that there is always someone
that you should always be afraid of, that You should, you know, being a to in a relationship of a position towards you, so so far does it make sense
when you, when I think about, let me know people. Are you guys there, too, or or everybody know i'm so tired, you know i'm going. We're so you're too boring.
Makes sense.
Okay, makes sense. Good. Thank you. So look.
Is it the kind of I think about Canada? Do we get that in Canada.
Probably you're gonna tell me no more cell, you know. I mean, you know that's not how you know our society goes. What you're describing here when it comes. For example, individuality here is the opposite. Our society is exactly the opposite of Big Brother. Think about children
now. I don't know if you guys have children, or if you have siblings, or even think about yourselves, because you might be very young. So I mean
kids, they have options. What kind of outfit. What kind of clothing do you want to wear today? This, this, this or that? We have a lot of options? There is a huge encouragement for us to, you know, be ourselves for us to be unique, to feel unique, to do things that are unique, to be unique.
right so that what we don't have that in 1984. Okay, we don't have this external
force controlling us. Oh, we have the government in order. We have the government in Alberta. Yes, we have law enforcement. We have police. Yeah. But you know nobody's, you know, like
telling you. You know you're not doing whatever you're doing. You're having the wrong kind of breakfast. No, I mean, you know there is surveillance, but it's not that.
and the governance is not through conflict, you know. Of course we do have. Sometimes we do hear narratives about us and them. You know them can be immigrants. It can be foreigners, it can be, you know, you know we can be the other, you know, but we sometimes we get that, but it's not really how we how we most of us, how we function
right? So
so here, let me let me just go, you know.
and kind of here. I'm gonna go over some of the excerpts and the the they're reading that I gave you the reading that I gave you.
He has a bunch of excerpts right like from the book. So i'm gonna i'm gonna go over some of it. The most important stuff just like to highlight some of this stuff for you. Okay.
Okay. So people
the book talk like the some of the excerpts they talk about people going to rally like rally goers. I don't know. If you guys remember that, please. You know now, it's the time that you go.
Oh, let me just see Joan here. What's an example? An example of service being terminal.
we're going to see that in the next to book.
But i'll give you right now.
Let's suppose that I tell you, Joy Joy, do you hear me? Just say as in the chat, because I want to speak to you here, and everybody else but joy. Are you there?
Okay, Great. So let's suppose I tell you
I tell you, Joy, I am going to give you.
I'm gonna give you a 10 percentage. I'm gonna give you 10 percentage points, people. This is an example. I'm not giving any points yet.
I'm gonna give you 10% 10 percentage points for you to show up in class. But the condition is you cannot be late.
Tell me here in the chat, or feel free to come to the mic. How you're gonna behave! Behave If I tell you that you're gonna get, you know, 10 percentage points in your final grade. If you're not late in class.
if you are on like exactly on time, every time
you're gonna be yeah, and in in. How are you gonna actually make that happen?
That being on time, what you're gonna do is you're gonna be Probably violence is saying, i'll make sure. Yeah, Exactly. But how I wanna I want to ask you.
You know people here, Greer, is it Pop? Pop? Am I killing your name, Grey, or it's a great or it's okay. Career: okay, Greer. So Gre, your Valencia and everybody else here. How do you make it happen? How do you? Yeah, You put an alarm clock. You try to remember You're gonna You're gonna rely on a lot of
devices, and even you know self. You're going to rely on a lot of devices that will help you. Do self surveillance.
Do you agree with me?
So that's that's it. So i'm giving you here an example of you know of a need terminal kind of surveillance.
So they're i'm gonna i'm gonna burn my lectures. I mean, not. We're like how to say that. But this is, i'm gonna just like, you know, whatever i'm gonna give it. I'm gonna give it to you right now. I'm not gonna wait until the end.
I'm: gonna you know, like the other kinds of governance governance that we have, and that's gonna be the brave new World. It is a a kind of governance that
that is internalized. You don't need any big, but all are telling you. It's just like the way it works. The bureaucracy the way that things work is just like they give you an incentive for you to do self surveillance, and an incentive for you to be compliance in compliance doesn't make sense. Let me see here.
Yes, but at the end of the day it's external, either. It is you I agree with you. It is, I mean I would. Oh, why sort of agree?
Because
he.
How do I say your name?
Okay, yeah, the trigger think with me? She? Oh, yeah, she I remember. Yeah, she be so. Shivi, it is
the trigger. The trigger might be external.
but the actual surveillance happens internally.
so the trigger. It might be me, the Prof. Telling you all you know. I'm gonna give you this, or it might be a discount store, like, you know. It might be, you know. Let's say you know it might be sport checks telling you, you know. Bring this coupon, and you're gonna get this in that or chop this, you know. It might be a a trigger might be an external trigger. But like the actual surveillance, the monitoring that data collection happens internally.
Okay, Also.
it makes sense. TV. Okay, good people, you stop me because this needs to make sense for you. Okay. So let's go back in here here. Rally goers. So what i'm gonna what those excerpts, Marcella. What about those excerpts, the excerpts that I asked you to read.
They actually
the purpose here is to illustrate those 4 boxes.
Okay, it's just to illustrate. Do you guys get it? So you know I, what I gave you is like for me ideas. And now we're gonna illustrate how that happens.
Okay, in society.
So here, let's talk about the rally. So we like in that society
every day
they do rallies. So what that means, I mean, you know you go outside. You let's suppose we're all at the over working, and then you go outside, and then you're supposed to, you know, like you know, like, do rally against some sort of enemy.
So you don't really know what it's the enemy. It can be anything but it just to rally.
And you, you know you kind of you put it out there just like when you are in a soccer game in Brazil or hockey game. Here you you just like scream your lungs, and you call all names that you want to call, and you you, you kind of you. You direct all your all your emotions towards that enemy, and it's going to be bad emotions. You just put them all of them, you know it's all kind of a catars. It's in English, or even it's like it's just you trying to kind of, you know. Get all the
bad thing out of you, you know. So that's what the party promoted. The big brother promoted that so
you know. So you you it's also. It was a way for you to regulate emotions, because if you get your emotions and you keep them inside.
it can be dangerous for the party. So the party just okay. I'm going to create a space where you go and it's mandatory. And you kind of you. You put all your emotions in there. Okay, I'll get to the chat in a second. So you just do that. So that was like those rallies, and also around is they were like, you know. They happen like every day all the time, you know, here and there, and and there was also something more institutionalized, something that was promoted by the school, the workplace
that was like something called 2 min hate.
So it was like it was a session where you would hate something.
you know. So
you know. So that was it. So keep this in mind. I'm gonna i'm gonna come back to that. So
in this society we had a lot of
just check the chat. The survey is also happening. If they are only
yeah, it does, you know it does.
you know, because when we engage in in self surveillance, right? So
we're the only one. Yes, it does. Okay, because ultimately. And here, Valencia, let me challenge you and everybody else ultimately.
even if there is just one way there is just like we are the only person observing our ourselves.
We always do whatever we do, because something that's social, something that relates to back to society or to our family, or to our friends, or you know, to get what I mean Like it's it's very. I cannot think.
I cannot think of something that in my life that I do that doesn't really.
you know.
speak back to society. Oh, Marcella, when you are at the beach in Brazil, kind of just like being lazy in some hammock, I mean, that has nothing to lose society has.
I mean, because I mean it. It's. It's very Brazilian to to be lazy on a hammer.
It's something that we don't do in Canada. It's very President to start with, so that in itself speaks to Brazil society. So it's. We are social beings right. So whatever we do speaks back to society somehow. So
anyways, back here in that society.
it was all about alternative facts
and
destruction of evidence. So the big brother, the the State. They worked in a way that they added events, historical events, and that was actually the job of Smith
is Smith had that job, you know. Oh, let's support. Give you a practical example. Let's suppose that we, or saying you know we were enemies. You know you were an enemy of let's say the Us.
Okay. So we are an enemy of the Us. And then let's suppose that for whatever reason the party, the party, the big brother, they make an agreement with the Us. And now we're going to be friends with the Us because we're going to sell something to the Us. And the Us. Gonna buy something from us. So now we are friends.
And then what? W: okay, but okay, there is a there is a a conflict here. Yes, there is. But the way that it works is like the party Order someone to revise all the historical documents and add it everything
everywhere where it said that you know in the us. They were enemies. Now it's gonna say that they were friends. So you know it's so. There was an entire department called Ministry of True Truth or miniature that did that kind of job. Okay, so.
And and here I don't know if you guys can see on the screen. But like, there is this quote.
Who
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the past, the present controls the past so that that's exactly what they were doing in, and this sentence became this: a phrase, this, this, this
quotation. It became very famous. I mean, you know, indeed, because you know people who control the past, they control the future. But people but people for for you to control the past. You need to control the you need to control the present.
So anyways like, I don't know. Try to wrap your head around with this thing later, and try to rep. Wrap your head around that sentence, I mean. But that was kind of you know they like. That was the summary of how you know all the the creation of facts.
And did you know the the you know the the creation of facts, and also the destruction of evidence, like the whole logic behind the creation of facts and and and destruction of evidence worked around. You know, this logic of you know who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. Okay?
And and i'll another thing that a lot of the information
was added, you know, for for to make the the leader look like more kind of, you know, to look better in people's eye. So you you, you know the leader, would never be caught in some sort of contradiction, you know. So
there was also in that society the fear of others, so like the all there could be anyone. It could be a foreigner. It could be, you know, a war enemy. It could be someone who who did not like, who did not support the party, you know, you know. But there are. There was also the idea of ordering the idea of placing someone in that position of other that you would hate. That was part of the governance. So you you, as a citizen of that society, you would be always okay. Who should I hate
right like you should. Who is the target? I mean so.
And and also like that idea that you should like that that kind of idea you should always fear and and hate. The other was legitimized, was made legit, and also reinforced.
for example, through public executions. So there was a lot of enemies. They would be, you know, executed in public, and people would be encouraged to, and and then they would kind of scream, and that will become a rally like you screaming, and you know, like that's that to that person. Right? It was awful right.
Few good catch phrases. There, there's a lot of few good catch phrases throughout the book and throughout that society. But essentially what we can summarize all those few good catch phrases into, You know kind of happy life, kind of propaganda.
you know. So it's just like you know, propaganda, that you know we are great, we are, we are wonderful and and and like our, you know, like if if that was Alberta, you would be the equivalent of okay. We have more oil than ever. You know our oil stocks. They're super high, you know. The price of oil is going up. You know we are all happy. Every Alberta has a a a family doctor, You know every Al Alberta baby is like healthy. I mean, you know that kind of
happy life. Successful kind of, you know, governance kind of narrative. Okay.
they churches, was another.
It's very important facet or characteristic of that society. So like we have excerpts, you know that illustrate that.
And and and the idea was whenever you other
the other person like. Whenever you have an enemy, you know. That was in some, Somehow that enemy somehow reinforced the idea that you are good.
so you know you would. The the the idea of an enemy would always come together with the idea that our country is better like. Oh, there is this person, you know the enemy and and the enemy comes from this place where it's awful, and we are better. So. There's like, you know this the idea of patriotism right like.
but in patriotism, not in a not in a way, you know, kind of good way. Oh, I love my country. I like my my culture. No, it we. It was always in a way that would undermine another culture or another country, right so kind of
there's no literature on that, but I would call it a kind of toxic patriotism, you know that is, it's not about it's like you undermine the orders to be, you know.
international relations was all about was very conflictual.
Enemies versus a lies
science. There was no word for you for it. So, Neil speak the the language from that society they eliminate the word science. So there was like there was no word for science. That was the way of making science disappear. So there was no science right in that society.
So it was all about principles. It doesn't matter if whatever science, No, it's about principal. If you believe in that you do it. If you believe that that's true.
you just do that. If you believe that you know that you know that you know this, whatever mad scene is good for health. Take it.
if you believe that that's bad for health, just don't take it I mean, you know it's just like. But again, but the principles they were not individualized. It. It was not up to you to take a medicine or not take a medicine. It was up to the government, and and here
I should. I should make a connection here with, like all the movements against the vaccine.
for example, a lot of the people. I've seen people against vaccine movements, a Ca questioning vaccine, and and and criticizing the Government use of vaccine not only Canada, but also Brazil and also in Europe, and France
a lot of the people when they were being in rallies against the government and vaccine they they were saying, oh, this is not 1984.
So I've seen in Canada, France, and Brazil signs of people saying, you know this is not a a 1,984. So there what they were alluding to this idea that the Government
tells you what to do right. So they they that a lot of the people I did. I didn't have a chance to to interview or do research on it, but like but a lot of like, just from reading the signs like that people were holding, like everywhere all the all the countries that I've been to in this Covid time I could see that they were questioning, You know. I mean the State can't do that to us. Right so. And they were.
They were in fear of their country so it could be Canada, Brazil, or France that you know, becoming
okay. So so this is something for us to think here, you know, and and and even for that, what's what's interesting about this book is that it helps us to interpret those fears that they had where they they were coming from right like.
So in terms of private emotion, As I said no private abortion whatsoever, and except if there was law for the party that was allowed.
and and there was a lot of thought control. So you know, whenever you had bad emotions or emotions, that you're not supposed to have, you had to engage in crime. Stop, right.
Okay, people. Am I making sense to you so far.
Is it insightful? Are you kind of all this is interesting? It makes me think, or it's just like super boring. You gotta tell me. You gotta give me feedback, you know, because again the purpose is like I'm telling you when you're supposed to be. Oh, I here and make your connections in your, you know.
in your head.
So here I am, going to take you to China now.
So I told you that this book was published in 1,949. It is not for the same year that the Revolution was happening in China.
so I would like to share something with you
for those I don't know if I have any people from China, or anyone who has been to China has said in China anyone who is familiar to China. But probably if I have those feel free to engage, and you probably you're gonna know what i'm telling you.
One of the first things that the Communist party did in China in 1,949, was to simplify the language, As you guys know, Chinese mandarin is a very hard language to speak and write specially right, just because he's. I mean, if you you know you learn like to write is really hard.
So the party had very high the excuse of the period that the most of the purpose behind was that at the time of the Revolution about 95 of the population in China they were in Literate. They could not read and write, and the party had this thing about modernizing the country.
By the way, very, you know in the in the 1984 you get this narrative about modern I modernization as well. Okay, you have this. All we need to modernize. You. Get that throughout the book.
so China had to modernize, and they had to take those people who are literature out of literacy. And one thing that they did was to simplify the language just to give you an idea.
If you see my screen right now, this is like
the work China, Chinese.
and and can you see that in here is also the award China and Chinese, after you know, being simplified. Can you see that this this character here?
It's very complex to right. Imagine you have to do this little box with like main strokes inside, and then they simplified. Look at this. So this became that, okay
or this other character. That is, it means a language. Okay, this is the word for language in Chinese. It was like that. It became like this. It became more kind of simple to write. So what? And actually this simplification happened in 1,950 a year later
they start to prepare the movement in 1949, and then in 1,950. They just simplified the language in case you're curious Hong Kong
and Taiwan.
They and also my cow in China. They do use the complex version. So we have the simplified version for all over China, and we have the complex version.
They like Taiwan, my account, and in in Hong Kong they kept, you know, the complex version.
So it's it's an irony that I mean. Obviously, when Jard World he wrote the book. He did not know that the priority was going to simplify the language. You guys get what i'm saying, I mean this guy was really a vision there like he. He he was really good, you know.
Lucy, Thank you for your question. Worldwide. Yeah. Like usually people now.
because China mill and China is so big it's so huge, it's so important, and became a huge like economy and a huge society very significant in the world. If if you, you, Lucy, if you're going to learn Chinese in Canada, you're going to learn the simplified version, unless unless you seek lessons from someone who's from Taiwan or or Hong Kong or Mccall. But if you're going to like the the norm, the standard language in China now is the simplified version.
Okay, is it clear. Let me know if that's clear.
So yeah, so I know I have a lot of I I I speak Chinese, and I write Chinese, and I write, simplified. I have a lot of friends who, especially those who research Chinese philosophy and also Chinese
Buddhism. Like religions in China. They they use the old version the complex version, because all the you know, the stuff that the research that they do requires that. But for me I do the simplified. I can read most of the complex, but I I write simplified.
and in a lot of the Chinese people they can read complex characters, but they write simplified me. Okay, you know, I I hope, if it's not clear, let me know. Okay, yeah. So Shinta is is correct simplified version. So governance. When we think about China, for example.
the entire governance in China from 1,949 all the way to 1,978. Look not today, not today. Okay, from 49 to 78
was very much based on conflict.
Marcella I don't get what you're saying. Let's just skip one slide here
i'm going to skip.
We just keep up your fuselides here. I'm going to share you some something. Look, look at this.
This is a marriage call
that Mao Mao Zedong. He is. He was the leader in China. Okay, he was. Let me just type his name. Now.
you know. Sometimes you also see like that. Say.
you also see like this? Okay. So mounted on, he was the guy who did. He was the leader who did, who led the Communist revolution in China, and when he was very young he wrote 7 of large polls that actually became the basis of the governance in China after the Communist revolution.
One of the articles that I love, and it's very crucial. Very important is this one. It's called Analysis of the classes in Chinese society. Look at the movie Skip the red, skip the red, and look at the first line in the article. This is just an example. So you see that i'm not coming up with like crazy things. I mean, this is real.
Look at this. Look at the the first line. Who are our enemies who are our friends.
And then he goes on right. Like.
So
this article is extremely important, because that governance between 49 and 78 was all about. If you are not my enemy.
you know you turn on, my friend. You are my enemy is very binary, extremely binary. Keep that word in mind. It's a governess, a binary kind of governance, and and and what he did.
this, this article he wrote before the Communist Revolution. But what he did here he was asking.
He was suggesting that after the Revolution Society should be organized according to classes, but like labels, so each person would have a label. And again, this is the surveillance. When I label you. I'm a collecting data on you. You become a thing, and then, you know I can do starts on you. I can govern you right. So so he created labels, and actually that actually was implemented.
And and in in in that society 1984, we didn't really have labels. We just had 2 labels, enemies and friends. Mao also had enemies and friends, but he also had he divided, and it is in types of enemies and friends and some types of of friends, right? So
i'll get to you in a second here, and just go back and tell you more, and also in China.
in China, just like in 1,984. We had denunciation, rallies or struggle sessions that need to what that? Was
those?
Where is it? Those 2 min hate?
Think.
because i'm the same. So here in China, you know, like I could, I could tell you forever about those I even have. I had a I have a friend whose parents was, you know, like wasn't an in China, and because that that the you know, anyways like my friends
father and mother was a university professor and the university professors. During the revolution in China they were considered enemies, so they had to like. They had to parade around campus, and people throw eggs and rotten eggs and poop tea on them, you know, and they they would have like tags like I have an enemy of class. I am an enemy, you know I am this, and that, you know they would like. You know they They would have like
flakes change to them like on their you know their necks. And so those were, you know. So they. So that was an example of an initiation, rally
or struggle, session, struggle. Session was Well, there was a little bit of a difference. The rally was, you would actually parade the enemies, and you'd, you know, curse them and throw things on them. But the the struggle session was like like, you know.
Let's suppose you would get me. I am the pro. You would get me in a room, and you guys would come in there, and you tell all the things that you think about me, and you'd criticize me and you'd insult me. You know that would be the kind of thing you know. That would be a struggle session, or you know sometimes you would. You would be forced to do that on yourself. You would come in, and you know, and expose yourself all you know. So that was very similar to what we saw in 1984, you know.
and individuality. China also was banned between 1949 and 78 again, you know, like you know, people were very
careful about their lives.
I mean my Chinese friends. They tell me that you know at that time they would. They would keep their feelings just inside of the family. They wouldn't share their opinions about anything, if anybody didn't know, and even inside of the family, sometimes they were afraid of sharing their opinions and feelings, and you know so any kind of individuality, you know, was banned. Everything was towards, you know, the the government, the State society, you know, the the the collective goals.
Anything that was an individual goal was banned. Okay.
So
i'm just getting to chat here.
Yeah, Valencia, you have a very good question, because the problem is.
I don't think
that the book influenced. I don't think I don't think that 1984 influenced like China, for example, I think that I don't think so.
I what I think that happened here is that, like George or he was very. He was a very good researcher, and he could sense
because I mean he could like, you know he could. He was observing watching society, and he could sense where he, You know Russia. The Russian revolution was much earlier, so he could see where things were going to, you know. And and then he wrote this kind of you know. He transformed
his observation observations of society to this Dystopian novel, you know. So that's what I really think. I don't think that you know this book had the power to influence anything you know like to actually make people, you know, duplicate or see on, You know I don't think so.
So at the same time, we we're gonna all your questions really good. But I say, we're gonna get there
elsewhere in the world. We didn't have none of that. But we did have the TV influencing people. We're gonna talk about that because that comes in the in danger view with Huxley. But hold their horses. We're gonna. This is very good what? You're what you're coming up with, you know.
Oh, let's see if there's anybody. If I miss anything, I don't think so. Let's keep.
So here is just to give you an idea. Okay.
So what this little drawing that you see here those 2. It's just like drawing of a china after the Revolution.
and the Government trying to show how wonderful China was. This was a commune in the countryside. Everybody working. Can you guys see everybody happy, you know, call like harvesting their crops. You know a lot of food.
you know, like, you know. So 90% of the people they this is just me for me to tell you guys at at that time in China, 1949 all the way to 78, 9, 90 of the population. They were rural, so they had a rural life. And then 10% of the population they were. They had a urban life, you know.
Marcella, how did how did you distinguish them, urban from rural, because people could move? No, in China people could not move. And why do you guys remember that household
registration system that I talked about less? I use as an example as class, because people had their classification, so they could not move. Okay, China, Just so, you know. But anyways, this is like posters. This is government propaganda. Those 2 are government propaganda
just to kind of exemplify how beautiful life was the reality people. The reality was completely different here in China, just to give you an example in 1961 1962. In China, 35 million people starved.
So life in rural China was nothing like that people were miserable just like they were in okay, They were starving. They were miserable, you know, but the Government had this happy life kind of propaganda, you know, like.
And this is my picture. This is not a this is me. Okay, this is just me showing how now you know, China is now different. The message here is, remember China, the China that I'm describing here, and I'm comparing for Sanya is not the china that we have today.
Okay, China changed a lot from 1,978 to today, you know. An example is like you don't see that separation. You see the buildings you see the crops. You see the corn, you know it's different. Okay.
Just see here
that you had.
So
yeah, exactly that to your yeah death March and starvation, etc. Exactly. That.
That's the reality. Okay.
So I we talked about this, and here the next is. This is like what it's written in here Chinese. It's here for you.
Excuse me a special agent.
Where are you running to?
So this is a government propaganda. This is like the god like After the Revolution, the Chinese people.
They were like a
chasing down the enemies. And here, if you observe this picture, you can see that the enemy was an American. Can you see here us
see where my curs are well done. If
if you see on the picture, I don't know if i'm putting the curs on the right place, let me, just
if you see on the picture here. There is a us thing here for you, you know, like
So
so this is just an example of the the the of this like enemy that we get in, I mean, I'm just using the Chinese example. So just so. You want to materialize it in front of you. You know
this is an honor pollster. Those are all pollsters. Okay, Government propaganda. If you put China poster.net, you're gonna find all of them there. There.
here. This is another example.
regulation of of the People's Republic
on punishing counter revolutionary. So all the people who were considered counter revolutionary. They were against the Communist revolution. They were on an enemy. And then, you see, like the the of the flashlight, is like you're giving visibility to them. It goes back to what I said is a very visible kind of governance.
like you pinpoint people. You tell you what I mean. I'm going to catch you, you know.
So this is another example.
This is like late marrying late has many advantages. One of the first things that the Government did well the Communist Government did in China was to raise
the the age, the marriage age from 18 for women, and 20 for men to 20 and 22.
So we went from 1820, 2022. Why? Because, like the population, was always like part of the governance narrative, like, we need to control the population we have too big of a population. So everything like the population was an excuse for everything.
So if they need they, they actually they didn't have the money to feed everybody that was a reality. But then, like you know, all that all the sudden it was like, you know, you know, like early early marriage is not good late. Marriage is good, because
that's good for the country. They just don't take exactly what that is. So it's kind of that. The same idea in in all you don't really know what's going on. But you just know that, you know. And if you ask why, first of all, it's, it's it's wrong to ask Why, it's it's wrong. You never can challenge the party by asking why. But if you know, if you ask why, people say, because we need to modernize.
it goes back to the idea of double. Think you don't. Really, you know, I think that they don't really make sense together. Okay, if we're going to modernize.
you know. But what? What? How about like late marriage? What does it have to do with modernize me, you know, like things are not obvious. You know Everything's kind of, you know, hidden, and and you can't really challenge anything
but regardless the discourse about population, population, and modernization, population and happiness. You know that that was a big theme in China, and also in If you read the book.
And then it it became like propaganda about Birth Control.
you know Birth control. It was, you know, again, as I told you, you know you could only have sex if there was, for procreation
in China was a little bit different. I mean you. You could have sex, but but it still, like sex was the whole thing was procreation, because.
you know, birth control, you know, wasn't quite there, and then it became something. And then the Government start to use birth control, you know, and and tell people who don't have kids, and then they implement their one child policy. But the point
the point is that those regimes there is a a big attempt and a a very huge attempt to to regulate people's sexuality.
So you know, Cnn. And in China is all is all about, you know. Let's regulate people sexuality, so it can be. Either you have sex for creation, or you have sex or whatever; but, like the government, is always kind of intruding in your in the bedroom, like you know, in your sex life. Let's put that way.
Another example here. This is an example. When the Government launch it.
people the people's community. China. Okay, the people's community. Was this: this, like the idea that you know, is is the basis of common, is that we all produce together, and we share, You know, the the results of the production, you know equally
so, which can be very unfair to some people. They do work harder than others, but but again, in common is that everybody's the same. Everybody's equal, and you know it. We share so. But the main point here is this narrative of a very happy life. It's almost like, you know. Now we're gonna have food. Look at this basket.
It's it has grains. He has food. He has like neat vegetables, you know. And then you. This is like being carried by the dragon. Dragon here means China, because China in China, like the symbol of Chinese dragon, so like, you know. So anyways, I mean the whole purpose just to show kind of give you some concrete elements
of the book.
You know it's all to kind of teach you, or kind of we make you think about those 4. You know those 4 points that we are discussing. Okay.
So what you are learning. Now, if I am doing a good job is that I mean, you're going to be able to identify.
You know types of surveillance that they are more visible, more forceful. You know that there's no space for individuality, and that you know it's it's done through conflict. Okay, so so that's my goal here. I believe, from achieving my goal. But that's the point.
So far any questions Did I make sense to you?
People? Are you guys awake?
Yes.
okay. Is it interesting to to kind of, you know.
the examples are really interesting. Now.
Yeah. So okay, so good. So I know that i'm kind of taking too much time. But it's okay, because I I know that next fast, you know, I we can manage. But anyways, let's I. I still have a couple of minutes here 10 min, right like I have 10 min. So let's start here Fragments from brave New World. By Avos Huxley.
Now, I would like you to forget about what we just learned.
Okay. So now we're gonna to something else.
We're gonna see something that's actually much more closer to what we have here.
And i'm gonna give it to you. I, personally.
I don't know what kind of surveillance is worse.
Worst works. Sometimes I think I used to think before I I have. I had classes with Hagerty, and I read all the literature that you guys are reading, and I took my time, and I went back to China to do to this, to to to, to to collect data on surveillance.
I don't know today. I sort of think that I You know that life under the big broader might be even easier. I don't know. Sometimes some days I wake up, and I think, okay. Life under 1,984 is gonna be easier than life in the brief new World. I don't know. Sometimes today as of today. I think that the brave new world is harder.
you know, and you guys are gonna go like. What is that even possible? No, I don't know I I can. This is this is, I mean, the point is here is not which one is works, but it's more kind of see. You can see different types of surveillance.
So look, this book was published in 1,900 and
32,
and I and that that's what makes me find this book amazing, because you know it it talks about today's society in Canada, for example, it would be applied to Canada, and it was written much before you know
what we having I mean. You know this guy for me, the Prof. He was a truly visionary. I mean, this guy is like he rocks my world.
I highly recommend this book people.
So the place is the same as London. Okay. The chapter that I gave you to read is it for is chapter number one. So just kind of invite you. I gave this chapter on purpose, because maybe you're going to like in order to read the whole book. So. But it is about. It is a tour. Someone's taking a tour at the hot, at at a hatchery
and conditioning center.
Okay, so it's like in the place where this in this society, in brave new World, the babies they are not made by humans. They are mating labs. Okay, so it's much more advanced. I mean the control of this state, and it's not really one state. I mean, there's not one big brother. There are many big brothers.
Okay? And that's what I like about that, too. It can be the state. It can be the the big company can be Google. It can be, you know, Amazon it can be, you know. I Food it can be, you know.
Do we have. If we don't, we don't have my food here. I Food is in Brazil. Here is skip the dishes. It could be uber. It could be, you know it could be the State. It could be the government, it could be, it could be the school. It could be anywhere. It's for me. It's more kind of, you know, complex to it's a more complex kind of idea.
But anyways, in the regime
the regime there was an authoritarian regime. Okay.
and it was. You know, English Socialism here. It's more like, you know, a democracy.
You know the way that the book is kind of set and kind of democracy where people have choice where they can side about, they can make choices about their lives, you know. So it's much more a democratic society language. They Don't really have a dictionary. They do have special words. Okay.
But what's interesting here is that you? Months are classified.
There is a language for you to name humans. So we have Alpha Beta, Gamma Delt and Epsilon people.
So whereas before we had just enemies, and in France and and here it's much more complex. It's almost like
There's we need to society. We need absolute. Who, you know, do the work that you know that some some people don't want to do so. It's almost like the society that we have here today a society where there's no space for everybody, not everybody can succeed, because there's just so many positions in the Government for each work, or, if you want to, you know, be a professor. There are just so many propositions, professorships for you. So there's there there many more people who want to be so there! There's not space for everybody. There's no room for everybody.
and society is organized in a way where certain people are going to make a lot of money, and they're going to have a lot of prestige and certain people. They're going to do very little money, and they're going to work that are not prestigious. Right? So so we have those kinds. So in that hatchery we have those kinds of people being created right. So
I know i'm down to 5 min. So Mr. Foster is the director of the center, so he is giving a tour.
And then here we in this book we also have a deviant character. His name is Bernard Marx. Okay, this guy's deviant because he's an Alpha, but he's too short for an Alpha.
Okay, so. And he always feels bad about himself because he doesn't quite feed the profile. Okay, so this and there is a profile. So here, let's just do this slide, and then we've finished the rest next class, and then we all we're going to do full call and delays to next class, and i'll try to be faster. But look at this.
The type of surveillance here is invisible. There is no sinister person, you know.
trying to kind of nail you or catch you or watching. You know
they're just in personal forces. They're a bunch of in personal sources. So it is the Prof. Giving you extra points to show up in class. It is the Gpa. Scale for you to study, so you can go to medical school. It is like, you know it is like, you know, we
your school kind of like, you know the the the 8 people class and be people class, you know, like you know the sorting. There's a lot of sorting society.
but there's no like it's everything is invisible. You don't really even think about so when I gave you think about your prof giving you an extra kind of credit for you to be on time? You guys never thought about that as self surveillance, right? So you you can. Oh, my gosh! You know this is surveillance. It's it's the worst kinds they want to be. I don't know if that's the worst kind, but I mean it is the kind that it is inside of you
right that you bring it inside is almost like the big, broader inhabitants You right. So
monitoring
very internalized self censorship, Individuality there is like
It's super welcomed. It's all about. You gotta be yourself.
You have so many choice. The options to choose from.
You know you have so many, you know you have like. Look at the span.
I have like 4 callers, this Wonderful! I have options, but again
it's it's almost like options within a pattern options within a range. You go to save on foods, and then there is like this whole like, you know, hallway, pack of cereal overse. I love cereal. Okay. You go by cereal like you have, like a a lot of cereals that you know at I say, on phones.
But if you actually read the ingredients, they're all the same. It's just some sort of flower with some sort of call calling, and it's just a shape that changes
right, and then the level of sugary. That's it, I mean. But it's the same. It's pretty much the same if you do that kind of survey, and you're gonna see it. So so there is a lot of like there's a thing you know. Buy me, buy, you know, like someone tells buy from me by from me. But essentially you're buying the same thing. So here is like, you know, a lot of callers, but still the same pen, you know.
and data like individuality, take note of that. Individuality becomes data.
It becomes data.
your behavior, your individuality, your likes and your dislikes. It becomes it becomes a threat of data that's going to feed some sort of system, right? So. And governance happens through compliance. So I don't need to, you know, to be harsh on you. I don't need to make your rally a rally.
I you know I don't need to make you, you know. No, I. You are willing to apply, because you know you want to be an an alpha you, you know, like you want to. You know you want to be a better If you are excellent. You want to be bad, or alpha, I mean, you know there's a sense that you know that you You want to change your life. You want to to grade your life so you comply
right? So so. Look at the same thing that I did with your other article like I went over the like some of the excerpts You're gonna see later here when you actually read. If you haven't read yet you're gonna see that my, my, my butter points. They coincide with the actual text, you know.
And here i'm going to do the same thing for you. I'm going to highlight. Some of this stuff.
you know.
and I am going to then talk a little bit about the interview with all those Huxley. Okay? And then we're going to do the the rest. So I'm going to stop here for today.
and I do have all sour today in case you need me, i'm gonna be here.
It's, it is another link. It's not on the same link, and and I think that's it for today.
Let's see if you have in case you have.
I've been a sore throat since Brazil, you know. But anyways, if you have any question, please stay on the line here so I can address you. We have 10 min before my my actual offs hours. I can. I can use that 10 min with you. So that's all, for today. Is it making sense people. If it's not just stay on the line. I want to make sure that you guys get it that everything is in order. Okay, so Thank you so much. You guys take care of yourselves and do that. What I ask You keep
watch, surveillance, start to kind of classify surveillance. All this surveillance is more like 1984, this one's like more like a brave New world. Okay. So start to kind. Of think about surveillance and classify surveillance. Now, okay.
Thank you very much. I'm: I'm gonna look from now on. It's gonna be live lecture. So you know it's unless I have something urgent. But otherwise we live. So I I see you again on Thursday. Live and thank you very, very, very much for being here. And you guys take care.
Thank you. Everybody. People.
Yes, always recorded. Always my lectures there, all regardless. They're going to be always reported always. Okay.
Okay, good.
I'm going to stop a recording just in case
let me trust me anything.

Jan 19

"Hello, everybody, Welcome back. Do you guys see me? Do you hear me?
Hello, folks? Okay. Chats here? Okay. Great. Okay. So how is everybody. Today
I came all pumped and excited about to this class. Are you guys doing well?
Okay. So look
not too bad. Okay, not too bad. Not too bad it's not very good.
Okay, look, look, folks. Let me just share. I'm sharing my slides. I'm just to get them up. So okay, here we go again and just duplicate this line.
Okay, so let's see if you see me. I see the chat right here. Okay, we're good to go. So look
last time we met we talked about like, not like novels. We talked about the big brother 1984. I told you a lot. About it. I gave examples of it, you know, and
we stopped. I was talking about brave New World.
which is another novel. It's by the professor of the guy who wrote big brother I mean. His name is Ados Huxley. So we're talking about him, and I was stabbing. I gave you some like very context. I mean this this chapter Number one that I gave you. It is a hatchery in London.
and and it's pretty much like it's. It's a procreation center, but it doesn't really involve humans, because everything is is done through. It's like you know it. It's it's done through like, you know, in in the lab.
right? So it doesn't really involve humans. Of course you do have sperm that do have embryos and everything. But it's, you know you don't really have human contacting there. So essentially we're talking about like life being reproduced in a very artificial manner.
Right? So that is the context. This society just like 1984. He had a slogan, but it's kind of the opposite. This looking for 1984 was about war, and here's about stability community identity. So it's completely different. I told you that the setup here it's much more democratic. It's much more like what we have
in which they society, especially like here in Canada us, and you know, in the western side of the world. Let me just see. Okay, we're good. So if you have any messages, just put in the chat, because I have the chat writing for in front of me, and I told you that in this society
we don't really have book a new kind of a new speak a kind of a new vocabulary. But we do. You know, we do have distinctions for people. So we have like, because humans they are made in labs and and so like, that's in that society they are able to. Okay, we we need X Alpha, which is going to be the people who are very smart they're going to do, you know, high tech work, and then we need people who are absolute because they are not smart. They but they are like from the body perspective very strong. So like this novel
it praise, or it relies on all these stereotypes that we have in society. You know those stereotypes that we have all you know. This is manual work, this intellectual work. This is like your hands. If your hands are very fine, that means that you don't really do manual work all those which in those are stereotypes. They're not really true, right like, but you know, in that novel they they like the the author uses that stereotypes, because sometimes, even though those stereotypes they're not true. They are like generalizations.
We we use that to discriminate people. I mean i'm not saying you me, but like in society, you know we use that to discriminate people. So that's why kind of the offer you so you can. It can kind of show hierarchy in society. Okay.
So essentially the chapter that I ask you to read is like a tour, As I told you before, it's a tour, that hatchery which is in London right so. And I told you that this, like the power like governance surveillance in that society called Brave New world.
Yes, it's invisible.
You don't really see there is no like one sinister person trying to control everybody just like the big brother. There's not not such a thing. It happens very in a very silent way through organization, through procedures, through, You know, interpersonal
forces, it's like governess and surveillance happens through technology. So you don't really realize that you are being controlled
right so. And even like when you look at I mean, I don't know if you guys have the chance to read. But you when you read that chapter it feels like, oh, there's nothing wrong. It's a nice environment, air conditioning everything's clean, so it's just this guy, you know, like showing someone else. You know how babies are made, and different kinds of babe, and how they make like excellence, and all fuzz and bathtubs. Right? So it's Everything's very clean. Everything looks very scientific. The opposite of 1,984,
where even the word science doesn't really exist right like the and the monitoring. A lot of the monitoring is just self censorship. People know that they have to do, they know, and the the the lab procedures. For example, they know that, you know, if this baby is going to be an Alpha baby, you know you, the temperature got to be this or the procedure going to be that so we do, since I mean not we them. They're the novel they do censorship self censorship right? So they control themselves so they can control the environment.
Right? So
individuality, it's very it. It's actually welcomed.
So you know, people are. You know they're they're actually made clones that like this this they are actually what they're describing. There people is what we call clone, like, you know, like you remember the dolly like those little calls that like in the in the nineties, that they were the first animals to be cloned. So that's what it is. It's a cloning process. So so, but they do encourage individuality. However, just like I was telling you it is individuality within a parameter.
So it's like, okay, we're selling you like cereal, just like my example. Last week you're gonna go down, you know, save on foods. And you're gonna go shocking for for cereal. You're gonna find like I don't know hundreds of boxes, and it it looks like it feels like I have a lot of choices, right? So. Which one do you want? Do you want that that one, but when you actually
look at it grow closely you'll see that it's pretty much the same. It's flower some syrup, you know. Some. You know, some coloring and and and different shapes, and and different types of sugar. That's it. So it's the same. It's actually the same stuff.
but you know, but like it, there is this kind of little difference within the parameters that our time just all this one's better than the other one, and I like this one, and my brother, my sister likes that other one right? So
so it's about choice. So I tell you. You know you can do like professors at the of a. They tell you, you know you can do. Take home, exam. You can do, an you can do a multiple choice exam, or you can. Do, you know, some artwork or whatever, but you've got to do an exam, so there is no way out right like, you know, for those choices
with them to feel in that society brave new world, then we are very free. But actually the choices, you know. We, I, I ask myself, are we are we really free? And I would say, perhaps we are not free. What we have is autonomy.
autonomy, people is one thing. Autonomy means, okay. I can choose between whichever serial. But that's autonomy. But freedom is it really freedom? Because I mean, you know it's it's within the parameter. So this is something for you to think about. Okay.
and the governance happens through compliance. As I said last time I, there is nobody you know, like poking you. You got to for yourself. I got steady. I got to do well, because you know I need my Gpa, so I can go to law school. I can go to whatever school I can do. My second clinical psychology I can, you know, do whatever so you know it. You don't need anybody, I mean sometimes your parents might remind you of that. Some pros might remind you of that. But you know you know the way the game goes right. It's like.
you know. It's almost like. If you want to do that, you have to comply. And and pretty much in society people for everything that we gotta do. We gotta comply. I dare you to tell me here in the chat something that you know you do without any sort of compliance. It's really hard to think of something that you know that we can be truly, truly, truly free.
By the way, share with me if you have something in there, you know that I mean where you can truly be free, you know, like there's no kind of you know, self, surveillance, or censorship, or you know that, like they need to comply, you know.
So here, like, let's just go over. I'm gonna break a little bit. So what I mean, I kind of already said, but I want to emphasize this. So look.
I just close this thing here.
Okay, clean, clean cleanliness. So it's all clean it's all clean. It's scientific. It's bureaucratic everything's organized within the bureaucracy. Paperwork procedures
everything very organized, and and in that case of this book it's very. It's based on the agenda eugenics. So you have Gen. X. For those of you who Don't know is when you start to do social sorting, You're sorting humans according to physical and genetic care. I mean physical characteristics that they go back to genetics. So you are. You're kind of manipulating people's genetics so they can. You know you can change people so in. And and this this movement.
Eugeneics that was a very common movement in 1930. Even here in Alberta we did have the otherwise. You guys know that, by the way here in Alberta we had in 1920. We had the Sterilization Act. Have you heard of that? People?
Are you guys there.
or I am talking to my walls. Okay.
you heard right? So the way it worked it that look in that something. Let me let me let me clarify this. It actually it target everyone in society, not on indigenous people, Just so, you know.
but in the end indigenous people. They were the people who were the most like caught by the act, but like it, it it was for everybody. The rule was. And I know this because I actually read a lot about this thing. But the rule was that if you had any kind of mental health.
illness, or disorder, let's say depression. Ptsd. A. D. G. All those things that a. D. A. D.
Attention, a. Dg: right like it did it? A: Well, I think that's it.
Adhd that's it. So if you have anything, yeah, add okay, so any any of those things. Okay, that's correct. Thank you. Thank you, Lucy, and everybody else. So look, if you had any of those things that at that time they were. They weren't even like classified. They were not categorized at that time people in 1920, or 10, you were like. Oh, no, I kind of i'm feeling blue. You know anything
that. And then people take you to a hospital to see a doctor. The doctor had the power to classify you as as a mental health patient.
and that allowed a panel, a PIN of 5 people, 5 people
to decide if you should be sterilized or not.
and that will. In the in the beginning the very beginning was about mental health, but very quickly. They came out also about sexuality.
For example, people women who were too mainly like short hair, you know, for example, or they were deemed again, people deemed too manly, right, like they were challenging the standards or men who were like
according to the standards I mean true, feminine. If you were deviant somehow, if you're like, if you deviate from the norm, whatever was the you know, the standard. At that time you could be classified as a mental health patient.
and that qualified for the panel to decide on your life. So in the end, you know, in most people I mean most people, especially if they, If they were white and rich, they would get away with it, you know. So there was. There was no way that let's say.
Okay, how? Okay, Jessica, I'll come back to you in a second in a second. So, but at that time there was no way that if your your dad or your mother, they were rich farmers.
if they will, they would never allow anybody to touch you, and and to, you know, to sterilize you. And and but that was a reality for English Scottish people who came to a burden made money, but for everybody else was poor, and and also, you know, indigenous people. The reality was there, was they. It was very hard for them to get off the hook.
and they would actually be sterilized, you know. So in the end about 4,000 people got sterilized in Alberta, and and when you go back. And that excuse was this person who has a mental illness is diseased. Okay, disease with quotation marks and this person
it's genetically the they, their genes are bad. This person has bad genes, so we cannot allow this person to pass those jeans, you know, downward, you know, to to their, you know, like children and grandchildren. So so that's why they would sterilize right. But that. But when you actually look the files
of those 4,000 people who got sterilized. You see that their parents didn't have any problem.
So that means, I mean, if this, hey hereditary, I mean, that would come, you know. But it doesn't, I mean, you know. So, anyways, like he he held no scientific evidence. But people are being sterilized, and I have a lot of material that if you're interested. If you ever decide to do your your let's say your capstone, whatever you know your owners, whatever in this topic
you could, you could go to the Alberta Museum, the one that's been downtown, you know, you know. Anyways, I I can give you you contact me, I can tell you which one exactly, but it's the Provincial museum, and they having their all the files from those 4,000 people. And you actually can examine them, you know. And actually I think that some of those files were thrown away, I think actually now they only have 900 something, you know. But anyways they do have files. Okay, just about
ourselves. You find the norm. I love this question because the norm is volatile, keeps changing. So, for example, the norm, like 1,000. 911,920Jessica was that a man had to dress in a specific way. A woman had to have those like long gowns, and you know, and like hair, long hair, a woman would have to marry very quickly, like at the age of 1819, you know, as soon as she would get her first menstruation should get Mayor. I mean there was an arm. So today we don't have that Norman
any more social norms. They keep changing. So you know, when I say, according to the norm, is the norm of that time, I mean, you know again, you know today, if you have short hair like myself. Nobody is going to challenge your gender or your sexuality, because, or even make any connection to mental health because of your hair right? So I mean that change it and change very quickly, like in in less than a century. But you get the points of social norm, is whatever is established at that time, or, you know, in time, I mean in very
over time. Okay.
One was the act that that to other only No, No, no, they were the Jenna. The act was from people who were deemed mentally you.
However, this classification, mentally ill, was too broad, and anyone could be thrown in there again, a woman who did not actually their their files in there, of women
who did not want to get married, for whatever reason, you know, but there was like scandals. How dare you? You know that means that you have a disease. You have a mental disease, I mean. When I say those words loaded, I mean, I i'm reproducing that time. So put some quotations in there. Okay.
it was just a cover. Yeah. But you know, Raj: like the problem there was that the people who were behind this thing they they, they! They! They were full of good intentions. They truly they truly believed in that stuff they truly believed in that stuff.
You know they weren't like they. It is, it's just a i'm not excusing. I mean.
if someone was alive today they would get themselves in trouble. Just probably some people even got, I don't know, but like. But the problem is that was the mindset at the time not excusing. It was awful like I'd spies that right, but that's what they would do, and they had good intentions, and eventually eventually 1940 S.
People started to this. Is not this Doesn't doesn't? Make any sense, and then people start to challenge that, you know. And but that act was was
hosting English. It was like valid until until 1972, or 76. Anyways, I I have a lot of material that why I bring that up because in brand. New world is exactly what we had here in Alberta, you know, back in the days.
So you know this kind of your Gen. X. You know we can't let you pass your bad genes, and we have to kind of, you know, create humans who are perfect, and not only perfect, but perfect for different types of work in society. So we're gonna have the intellectual. We're gonna have. You know, the manual worker. We're gonna have different like types of manual workers, you know, all the way from someone who does like the very work that nobody wants to do all the way to someone who does the work that everybody wants to do, because well paid, or it's well regarded.
Right. So so that was the point in brave new World, the main, the main like incentive for voluntary compliance was a reward exactly the example that I gave you the other day, you know, to do something for me. I'm gonna give you a point.
you know. So not from now on. People be very, very careful with like what we call in English carrots. I'm talking about the vegetables because I have an accent, so I don't know if you get it like. You know the rabbit carrots. Be very careful with that, because sometimes people tell you things.
and they take you kind of you. Go. I'll give an example here personal example.
I I did a job. I I want to scroll as much because I mean, you know. Anyways.
I did a job interview to be to be a a full time faculty member like to be a profit. Some very big university here in Canada like a couple weeks ago, and and when I did this job interview they showed me the salaries.
and I was like, come on. You know this is too little. I have a lot of experience. I have a lot of money research like research money. So this is like. And then I was telling the person I mean, this is like, you know I mean I was. Of course I wasn't saying like this. I was very polite, very. You know all we know. Yeah. Well, this is a little bit disappointing. I will say, you know, like. But then I was chatting with this. The you know the person like the someone from the hiring committee.
and this person was like No, no, you don't have to worry, because if you come to work with us. One of the nice things that we do is like, you know. We give you a $50,000 for you to purchase, you know, to do the down payment on a home.
So people in general I mean I I i'm older people I I have, I, you know I
people who are kind of more like more immature than I am.
They would just fall for it. It was like, oh, this is amazing. You're gonna give me $50,000 for down payment. And indeed it is really nice. But when you look at the prices of that region in Canada
is just like astronomical. The real estate price that $50,000 is. It's not gonna be enough even to it's not gonna be even like, you know. You know, a quarter of of the down payment, you know, if you guys get what i'm saying so like people sometimes, and i'm give you here, you know, like when you do job interviews, or when you do anything.
be careful because people they throw like rewards that you and so isn't that nice, and then they put you in that kind of frenzy. Oh, it's nice! And then you kind of go with the flow, and then you go like, oh.
like shoot! What do they do? That's not worth it. You guys get what i'm saying. So be careful because society, brave New World and our society is all about that, you know. Like.
Yeah, Exactly. Exactly. Oh, yeah. So you you okay, I'm: yeah, it did so. The like, the Greer. Yes. So the the the act obviously in the end. All those 4,000 people who got sterilized, I would say that 90% of them they were indigenous people.
Okay, so it became a and another thing it became. It became a strategy, you know, to to eliminate indigenous people from society.
So it's it's just awful when you read that there is one professor at the University of Alberta
and also Valencia. You're right. Females. Well, I could just give a whole lecture on this thing. But, like Valencia, right females, they were more affected to the males. However, females Look, look! There's something interesting in here females.
because to procreate is something it's almost like divine. And at that time
it was almost. It was like something that you know it was religious. It was a religious topic, even to the to this day it is but at that time to pro procreation was very kind of, you know, a religion, you know thing I mean it's about religion you have to procreate. I mean, that's that's your mandate as a woman, right? So so that means what that? The panels they were more willing to reveal and revise decisions on women.
however, for men, they would never revise their decisions. So so like women got like, you know, on one side they were, you know they were like much more affected.
This is true, and on the other side for men, whenever they were, there was a decision on them. It's almost like there was no space for appealing.
Okay, so that was harsh, too. So it's like you, you know. So. But numerically yes, women, they were much more effective in indigenous women. Oh, my gosh, even more. So. Okay, you guys are pumping the chat Here, let's see.
I I agree. Yeah, exactly. You know you, we you we exactly like that's like what Can't said. And that's why I gave you that chance before, because I wanted to establish that. You know that that where, like our historical tradition, where we're coming from.
So, anyways be be aware of the carrier, you know the incentive. Be careful when people comes with a lot of carrots, you know. Raise your eyebrows and go like, okay, let me analyze this carefully, because
you might be you. That might be a tract. Be very careful. Okay. So like the like. All the the environments in in brave New World they are extremely controlled, you know, and and then, like they even talk in this chapter about something like a process called Boka Novicely book a novice key.
I mean. However, you on the call, I mean, this is a funny name, I mean. It's not like, you know, not funny, but it's on English, and but they they're actually talking about Cologne cloning, and that speaks to social stability. So essentially all that that control was geared
awards, trying to create this happy, you know, stable society, and that's pretty much what we crave. People Look, we crave that.
It's almost like we became child's children from the brave New World. We crave that stability, I guess. But, Marcella, are you? Do you want to war? Of course I don't want to war again. We are thinking Here we are, kind of, you know, making analysis. I don't. Why, I of course I prefer to do it. But like even though but it's almost like you know we
you know it's. You know we are in this boat like you know, the brave new world a kind of boat, you know.
so hierarchy, you know, like everyone is needed.
but it's almost like there is no space for everyone, so everyone is needed. There is a space. There is a space for everyone, actually, but not everyone can enjoy that very good space like that job with like status, you know, etc., etc. No, you know that's only for all phone. And then back to is going to be something that's lower. So I mean that there is this whole huge social sorting.
And this is really interesting. This is actually a line in the book that individuals are red destined so like it's almost like you. There is a mission for you, and you are also conditioned to that specific type of life.
So it's like there's no way out, really, and when I teach social problems.
my students, they come to me ourselves. Society is really depressing. It is. It is really depressing, because when I teach social problems. People.
I'm going to talk about income and income inequality. Do you guys hear me? Are you guys there?
Okay, I always get the same name. So I think it's just a few people who are paying attention here. So, anyways, okay, good. I see some other names now. Great. Thank you. People. So look when I, when i'm teaching a sociology tool, 3 at the U. Of a
or elsewhere, and I tell my people in classic people how much one do you expect to make.
and they come, and they tell me oh, I'm gonna make like after once you finish your degree. So people go. 60,070, 8,100, 110, a 199, 5, I mean, that's and then I make an average. I make an average, you know. People are kind of screaming, shouting their numbers, and I make an average, and then very quickly tell them. Look, the average is like let's, say you know, 9, 90 $98,000, and then I tell them people the average in Canada is 36. If you are a woman a man.
and in 32, if you are a woman, so it's like, you know. So it's I mean get Rio. I tell people right like you know it's almost like I. You know I I come with this like reality, like shocking reality, and people go. Oh, my gosh! It's almost like there is no way out, or you know, because we all have high hopes. We all we are doing this because we want to make money. We have a life. We want to be able to have a job going to be to raise family, or, you know, to do something right, all of us. We all have dreams. And then, when you, when we
look at society we see that I mean the the reality is really hard. One of the things that I hate doing is like going to the West Side with the Mall, because I see a lot of my former students working service there.
and it's for me. It's just like
It's just like you know. It's it's, it's, it's not about them, but we take it to the heart. We believe that it is about us. It's not about society. We feel I am a failure. Oh, I could not make it. Oh, I did not get in, or I. You know people. There is simply no space for everybody.
And what's interesting here in this society is that they they made that very obvious. They made that so obvious that they actually create the types of people that will go to specific types of life, you know.
And again, this is horrible, right? Like this is horrible. I mean the reality.
Let's see what else. Okay, let's see. Yeah, it is people, and you know, anyways, I mean, if I could go on and on. But I don't want to go on and on, because I would start to bring stats from social problems in Canada and in the that that that oh, my gosh, no, don't even get in talking about that. But like, you know.
anyways, so people let's move in here. So I would like to cover that interview. So I asked you to watch.
It's kind of a short 20 min something interview with
those Huxley.
and and the reason why there's certain there. Well, there, there's a lot of things that we can talk about this interview. I don't know if you guys had the chance to watch. But one of the things is that the the person.
Mike Wallace, who is interviewing him. His of he was in the fifties a very famous talk show, Guy, you know, just like we have now in the Us. And in Canada. People who interview people like late in those late night shows
this guy was a very famous one, and they interview. I don't know if you guys saw if you got that sense.
Mike Wallace, the interviewer. He was kind of like anxious, and he he did not realize, he the you know, like every time that Huxley was trying to develop some sort of idea.
you know he would be chopped.
and it's almost like Wallace. It was like, how dare you Are you talking about us, us American democracy as if we were a society of control, meaning opposite of a sign of freedom. And and indeed, Huxley was doing that, you know. I don't know. Did you guys get that kind of you know this kind of
this little stations? Okay, great. You got it. So let me see new lands. My education system separates feature.
Yeah. You see, Lucy, not only neither land, but also France Does that Germany does that as well, you know.
and I mean, this is like, you know. This is I mean again, I I can't say that it is what we see, exactly what we've seen brave new world, but it's kind of, you know. We see those kind of you know.
It smells like if I can put that away, you know it smells like almost right. So
so yeah, so you guys got yeah, you guys got it right? So i'm happy that you got it. So let's just move in here, so look
like I don't know if you guys so essentially. Huxley was trying to talk about. You know the rise of totalitarian regime. So he was very. He is personally concerned about that and pro. That's why he wrote that book a brave new world, you know, and and and he is not afraid of the big brother. He's afraid of those invisible forms of power.
So what like? Here are some of the those are the 4
contribute contributing factors to what? To the rise of totalitarian regimes. So here the first factor, according to Huxley, it's over population.
and he calls that an inter personal force. So he says, like, Look, we have a a situation on the world where the world has too many people, and that means that we don't have enough resources, and that means that that that requires
the government. They state to interfere in people's life.
and that for him is very uncomfortable, and I understand that I I can. I can feel that. And going back to my example about the vaccine in Canada, in France and Brazil I mean.
I Personally, I mean. Personally, I kind of I am in pro, I mean I I to call. I take every vaccine I mean if you come, there is vaccine. I just going there, but that's me right, but like, but on a kind of more societal sociological level, I I have sympathy for people who said, Look the Government doesn't. You know I can understand them.
I I don't join the movement. I don't kind of, you know, but I I can. It's almost like I can. I can see where they're coming from. That's how we we phrase it. I can see it.
because, indeed, you know, we had this pandemic, I mean, you know All of a sudden the government had to interfere, and it became mandatory, or it became, you know it made your life very difficult. If you don't take, I mean. So you know. So
so that's one. So that goes back to what I mean. This this idea of some sort of interpersonal force
that becomes a source of control society and the pandemic being the newest one.
you know that changed our lives completely and think about the level of security at the level of data collection that we have right now, even like me, we are recording this lecture, you know. I mean, there's much more. Everything became online, and there's data being connect collected.
Google collects data on on on everything. I mean, it's zoom. I mean, you know all those data collection devices, right? Like another. The second one here tied to second problem, tied to over population is the risk of social unrest, and whenever there is social arrest, law enforcement.
they up their game. That means more surveillance. Okay.
but essentially those 2 factors, I mean, you know, a lack of resource and risk of social unrest.
They kind of invite social intervention. That's what you know, Huxley was saying. And then technology was another factor. I'll get to the chat. And second technology was another factor. So he talks about, you know, like you know, that like like before, you know, we we used to have like, like like in here. They can. Also, you can understand my slide. This terror here is about him talking about like in a society where, you know, like people use technology to make terror
like there, or like to to make people afraid. But now we don't need that anymore. We have technology. Now you know that actually it's almost like it guides your behavior. And he talks a lot about the TV because
this interview from the fifties. So the TV was the main technology at the time. It changed society, you know, like people used to eat together, like, you know, as a family. And all the sudden with the TV people were kind of scattered. Each person had their own TV. They weren't even in the room. I mean, it really changed the side. And not to mention the message the TV TV was able to through TV. I mean, like, you know, like companies, governments, you know, people They were able to broadcast
like messages on a massive scale.
and that would God that can go over, and people's behavior in consumption and education in all aspects of life. Right? So so he talks about technologies, how changes in technologies they actually contribute.
can contribute, and often does, to the rise of totalitarian regimes. And then he talks about also over organizational, or like too much organization, too much like, you know. Institution too much bureaucracy too much, you know. So he talks about. You know
that everything more than ever. There is always a recipe for everything. So all you want to drop a class. Okay, you want to drop a class. You have to do this in that, in that you wanna you want to. You row in a class. You have to do this in that. You want to get your, you know. See a doctor you have to, you know. So everything is very, you know. There's a lot of organization happening society. And and when throughout the institutions and all of those organizations they are collecting data, and they are monitoring EU
right? So. And the last thing that he talks about in his interview is Soma S. O. M. A.
This is actually a drug. So in the book, in brave New World
the characters that book, whenever they were anxious or they were too tired, or they want to have fun they would take Soma. So Soma was this kind of multi functional drug that would make you happy, that that would solve all your problems pretty much.
and I I I I Anyways, I found this really interesting in his interview that he could. He is a Huxley. He was a guy that he himself
he was into drugs. How does he know genetic drugs like, you know, mushrooms that you know, like at the time there was not like stuff from the labs. It was like mostly like mushrooms and and and herbs and mix of herbs. So he was into that kind of stuff, and and
but not only like as a as a as a user but also he was thinking about that and kind of even criticizing it. So he criticized actually drugs, saying that you know that the the the the Pharma industry. Now it's almost like they. They find a solution for every problem that you have. But, Marcella Isn't, that a good thing? Yeah, of course it is right. You know. We don't want to deal. We we want to be healthy, but but on the flip side. You know it's almost like it makes you kind of. You know.
It makes you. You know it makes you kind of calm. It makes you. You know you. You don't, I mean, you know. If you don't go in rally you don't I mean you. You know you're always happy so in that sense. So, you know. Oh, my problem solved and happy! So it kind of you know. It brings this kind of
you know it. It's almost like it compromises your freedom to some it to some degree. That's what he says. Okay, again.
feel free to disagree with him. But but it changes our Member State, you know without us doing it. It doesn't do any harm to us. That's another beauty of the drugs, and also another evil of the drugs. I mean, you know it doesn't do any harm. It doesn't kill us on the opposite. It makes us, you know, happy and and to be happy in a society where you are being controlled all the time. It might not be ideal, because you're not going to complain.
Right? So let me just see here to chat. So I can see.
Yeah. So Raj.
Yeah. E: Exactly. Raj: You're right, because at the time you know, you had, Russia was already like a Communist in Power Empire and America portrayed him itself as like this freedom world where everything's fantastic, where you know, there's space for everybody where everybody can be free. And all of a sudden, there's this guy, you know, this British guy coming to the United States and saying, Look, you know I mean things here are not so free as they look like. So it is about the context.
And another thing I don't like to remember at the end very end of the interview.
They talk about elections, and in in Huxley talks about like, you know, the the politicians in the United States being just like puppets like changing themselves according to the you know, to just to please the population, so they can be voted elected Dean. And then then, like Wallace, the inter viewer was like, oh, you're saying that you know people are, you know people are like that. You know that politicians are lying, and that you know politicians. They don't really care about us. And and oh, Huxley goes like, yeah, that that's what I think. And while she didn't
kind of like that, you know, and
and and indeed people probably, you know, I mean probably you've seen a lot. I mean there, I mean, fake news is the biggest example here of how like you know, that makes a mix of technology and information can change the game in elections. Right? So those fake news they get spread, you know, through Whatsapp groups or or you know. And then that really changed the behavior of people, especially people who do not follow politics very closely, right? So like there's a like both science. Where? Where is the policy, science people
the part of science? I mean Palestine. There is a lot of people doing research on fake news right now, and how you know means information
really undermines democracy, because democracy is about choosing someone, and when you you you your choice is kind of glad. By some sort of lie, you know, or misinformation. I mean, that changed the game in democracy, right? So there's a lot of people in the science. They're big on that right now.
Yeah, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
Raj: I actually love what you said. People look at what Rajas Raj just wrote on the on the chat. You're right, but what you're telling me, and I agree with you. We have to be vigilant, but to be vigilant it means to do self censorship.
so it's almost feel like, feel like we are dropped.
you know. I agree with you, and I am always okay. Let me check this information. Let me see if this is true. Let me check this. Let me check that. But I am doing self surveillance.
I am served, Bailey, my behavior all the time to make sure that i'm not following the wrong kind of crowd, or you know that i'm not taking decisions that I don't. Really, you know that I don't really kind of agreed in the, you know. So so yeah, I know it's it's really nice, you know. So that's that's exactly that.
Okay, so and you see that kind of a finesse
in French finance, or that kind of finishing that you see in like Huxley, you don't really see that in in my opinion this is my opinion.
Okay, and probably after you kind of listening and observing for yourself, maybe you're going to agree. So this finishing this kind of finesse that I see in Huxley. I don't really see that in in in a in Jordan, you know. So they they're both brilliant. But I I find this other guy even.
But again, this is my personal opinion. People You don't have to go with my personal opinion.
Okay, so.
And then also one more thing that I would like to bring up to you in the interview.
Huxley says something like saying, Look
Communist parties across the world again. This is 1950 S. So he says Communist parties across the world.
They are better positioned to deliver.
Totalitarian is.
and I think he is right. I mean, you know, because and he says why he says Communist part is there much more cohesive? They have more internal cohesion. People are more united in their goals, you know. So that is kind of, you know.
And we saw that later in China we saw that in Russia, in in software, in North Korea and Cuba. So yes, you know he is not wrong. But the problem now is that democracies they They can be totalitarian, too.
because and that is kind of changed the like, the like political, social part of science concepts for those of you in Paul Science, I mean, you know that kind of definition of democracy, that kind of definition of totalitarian is when you look at them it's almost like they don't go well together. I mean, it's almost like democracy is the opposite of totalitarianism.
Yeah, but but today
is it? And this is a question for you to think about it and for you to comment on the chat. So you know, so is
democracy, they the the opposite. You know the anti thesis, or the opposite of of of a, of a of a I mean, you know I can see those 2 kinds of like political models
intertwining, you know, getting kind of entangled, you know. I can see that you know a democracy sometimes can become very totalitarian. We'll think about myself that I I don't think I shared with you that I lived one year in Singapore, Singapore. I don't know if you guys ever have ever been to Singapore or
anyways, if you know anything about Singapore, Singapore is really interesting. It is a kind of the democratic regime People can elect. They can choose their leaders, but it's a side of total control people. I was
in Singapore. I had my best ever job. I I used to work in a private sector before.
you know, getting crazy and and resigning and coming to Academy to get a Phd. And become a researcher, but like in Singapore, I was making a lot of money I was. I was living this anyways
from the money. Perspective was a wonderful life. I'll never make that money again in my life as a even as a big big prof in Canada, and and and but I was miserable, because that's I I hate living there. It's total control.
If you do anything wrong, anything, let's suppose you you know you. You're chewing a gun, a gun, and you're not supposed to that in Singapore. You throw that gum in a you know, in the the the garbage. Some police officers gonna come from nowhere and talk to you. Look you're not supposed to do that here. This is Singapore. I mean it's total control. You know
It's a, and it's the democratic regime, and it. It it it it's, it's. It gets very totalitarian, because I mean it's almost like it suffocates, you, you know.
Here
people
life in brave new World.
It is a dictatorship, but it is a dictatorship that relies on consent of the road. Okay, so it is like.
you know, even like sync up, or today. Some people in both science. They argue that Singapore is like more, much more. It's like a tick. It's it's not really a democracy. It's like a dictatorship and and and and it relies on on the consent of the world. The like. Most the people who live in Singapore, they they Singaporeans, they get to be very happy and proud of your country, you know, because it's ever it's super clean. It's super
everything works I've never. It's like crime is like 0. They have a 0 prime rate. It's just like amazing. I mean to see.
So let's see what My, if you say data collection through surveillance makes it easier for people to circulate fake news, because sometimes static news rainforests. Oh, yeah, and and and definitely, definitely, you know definitely, because I mean, you know, you know you if you want to put something on Facebook.
something like you know about anything you know any any like, you know you just all you have to do is just to pay a couple of $100, and you get that profile of people who like specific things. And then you feed that. You know that system right? Like you use that data collection. You use data collection to.
you know, to like to target the right kind of people who will buy into that. And and but then
here there is a policy
that we discussed earlier in the text. I mean, sometimes it doesn't work that that doesn't work, but like sometimes surveillance works in a way that I mean when I use surveillance data to target you
and and and then I I i'm also produces like data with that. So that data that I'm producing is kind of it's kind of it's kind of thought to logical. It's kind of you know it's like a a dog, a it's tail, or running after it's tail. So it's like there's a topology within the data. So it's like so, and then you know that data becomes not very good in terms of quality. So you know, that goes back to one of the fallacies that we studied.
So so thank you for your comment. I mean nice comment there.
Yeah. So I mean.
like I'll tell you here, Jessica
in Singapore, for example, or i'll give you the the example that I know best, because Singapore, I live there, but I never did research in there. In China I lived 7 years, and I did a lot of research. So in China, for example.
people
they are. They know that the government is controlling everything that they right on. There we chat. We checked like a little app like whatsapp it's just like Whatsapp, and also it's a multi functional app so that people know that the government is watching them that there's people that you know are doing censorship on those apps.
But you know people say you know i'd rather be like that, because you know it's safe. At least I know that. You know they are watching me, but also they are watching people. Who do you know.
child, pornography? They are watching people. Who do you know who are using the apps to plot crimes? I mean, you know. So they're willing to kind of afraid of it's a trade off, and here is interesting
dictatorships. They usually work out well.
If the Government is able to control the economy very well in a way that everybody has a job, or everybody has that sense that they are, you know, climbing up the ladders. You know that they are getting somewhere, that you know, if the government can produce that that kind of economy
people. Usually they are willing to to to trade their privacy and their data. But if.
if if that is not possible, you know. Then people start to complain, and then the government has to become harsher.
The that dictatorship becomes more kind of an external kind of you know, big broader on people. So when we look at China from 1,978 today, or even 1978, to the beginning of the 2,000
people in China. They were making lots of money.
lots of money, and everybody was super happy about it, I mean. So people didn't care much about the Government control in your lives. But today's kind of start I can see in China things starting to derail, because the economy economy is not doing as well as used to be.
People are starting, you know, to have their children's school, and then their children graduate just like you guys, and then, you know they finish school and they but they can't find a job, you know. So things are starting to get kind of a little bit more, you know people are not very happy with the Government, and in the new, that this President of China, Cgp. What is he doing? He's pressing?
He's kind of turning his turning. That type of totality like of oppression.
you know. Kind of it's it's kind of you know. Let's let the big broader outside the cage. So there is this movement in China.
Yeah. Usually when Yes, Jessica, when we look back at all the dictatorships in the world, and how they evolved over time we see that, you know, like lack of resources. Economy.
you know it becomes a an an up an an issue, and it leads to stuff to like like it. It leads to riots, rallies, and you know, and
very like, you know, sometimes most sometimes more fast, sometimes more gradually. But it usually, you know when we look at the end of dictatorship regimes, it has to do with the economy and the economy going down. You know Latin America is an example for for you, you know, like the like Brazil Chile. You know all the countries in Argentina all the countries in Latin America.
Yeah, exactly
like you're talking about China right like you, Lucy. Are you talking about China?
Yes.
let's see. Just see. Yeah, okay, China people from from like 78 to 2,000. They were growing 7,
you know, and then and then it dropped, you know, and then it dropped like 2, 5, 6, you know, like 3.3, 3 something was even before it was like.
because China has 2 historical period, like China, from 1,949, all the way to 79. It was a very close to, you know, like it was a very traditional kind of communism.
And then in that time, like the the growth rates, they were not good. They were like 2, 3, 4, and then, after you know, like 1978, they opened up to the world
China joined the World Trade organization, and they became a player, and then, like it, became, like, you know, 9, 7, 9. It would even almost to 10, and then now it drop back again. I haven't checked in the last 2 years how much? But I think it's around, for I heard about it. It's like 4 or 5, but it, you know I I would have to change. Check it right now.
Okay, I'll get to you in a second. Jenna. I have. I see your question here. Just let me just finish here. So dictatorship okay, relies on consent people. It's almost like people start to love their slavery and that it comes from you know this line comes from Huxley, too, you know. And and then my question to you
is brave New world compatible with democracy. I will say yes.
and probably all the offers that you're gonna read in this course, including Dr. Hagerty, I mean. Yes, they would say yes, you know, and not completely. Maybe not exactly the same. But but yes, you know. And and is there a space for totalitarian is in in democratic regimes? Yes.
so those questions, those 2 questions here are for you to think about them and and consider them, you know, in your life, not only for this class, i'm Just see here again. So Jana put the rise of fast, as I mean, for in 1930 S. And for it to be a kind of example this.
because before the world can it became
for? Oh, look, Jenna, here, let's let's not just say something for you
like fastest regimes, especially like those that we had in Europe like Italy, Germany, you know those Spain, Portugal. They are like there, like a whole area in itself. So you know, which is not my air of special specialization. However, I can say something to you.
I think that in both cases
you know what did like, you know Again, i'm not in a specialist on that i'll let you give you my my my view here. So when we look back, I think that the thing that actually
triggered that triggered that
was
was like his movements in society at that time 1910, 1920, those move movements that were kind of segregating
humans. So all of a sudden, like like like until the end of the nineteenth century. We were talking about
the human being, the human. We have a very humanistic
approach to social movements, and that had to lift the enlightenment. Okay? And then, in the 1910 twenties we start to kind of dissect. Now we have women. Now we have, you know, like now we have like sorts of all sorts of minorities in in Europe was Jewish, and then I mean, I think, that also also plays a factor.
You know that kind of
the like dissecting humans, which I totally understand why we did that because certain humans, humans, they're not all the same, and and and humans, all specific callers of a specific countries of specific, You know they are. They. They experience different lives just because of who they are. But but you know, so that that's one side. But on the other side you know that kind of dissecting of the human into pieces
that contribute to this idea. Okay, the Jewish are terrible. You know the Catholic are terrible, and the Lgbtq. 2 people are also telling me, because those are the they. They were the people who were target
by. You know the the the fascist regimes in in Europe, not only the Jewish, but also Catholic people. Lgbtq. 2 plus people. Now we call LGBT, but gay people or homosexuals. That was the language of the at a time right like. So so we have. So I would have to kind of.
you know. Give you more and discuss more, and also me study more for us to, you know. Talk about that specific, you know, when we go specific into the regimes in Europe. But your consideration, Jen, is really important, you know, because
a lot of I mean still a lot of what we are talking here. You know the idea of classifying people, the idea of surveillance that it was applicable at that time. So when we think about there was surveillance for people who are Jewish, or who Catholic or or or homosexual, or people who had any kind of illness by the way.
Right? So so there was surveillance for them. There was specific like protocols for them. So what you're saying here is extremely important.
exactly, definitely. But even like at that time those movements
like those movements that i'm talking about, that they kind of lay the groundwork for this division of human beings.
those movements they were actually they were actually very like
they were very liberal the beginning, You're very liberal. And then there was twist, I mean, like you know, like fascist, they they they kind of appropriated from those movements they approved, they, there was an appropriation of those ideas, and that in a tweet a per very upper version of the the the ideas. They were perverted. Almost okay.
So let me go back and hear people
and see what else. Okay, so here fake meals. This is something here for you to consider as well. So look that they can use as an example. I mean, we. We talk a little bit about that, and and and fake news happened
in in 1,984, and also in brave New World, because it's almost like you twist events, I mean in in 1984 fake news was obvious, because, even, like you know, the the main character. He was like Wilson, he was editing history right? He was editing. He's straight to make.
to patch to everything. Looks like we any kind of contradiction. All we were enemy. Now we're friends, so i'm gonna go back and add it all those articles that said that we were enemies. So so fake news is something that I mean, of course, now we see it. But the idea that concept of kind of you know, you know that is something that we're in those books before you know.
and fake news can twist. You can really part or pervert or change people's people's opinion. And in the case of democracy you do persuade people to vote according to you know, or against whatever news right like according to the news or against the news.
And I talked about that. So TV, I mean Huxley didn't know anything about the Internet because obviously there was no Internet at the time. So it was TV. So, and he was talking. He he didn't say that in the interview, but he almost said it was like, You know there is a new, because the guy Wallace says so. Do you think you are being brainwashed?
And then he says, yeah to some extent. Yes, you know. And then, like Wallace, Yes, him to give an an example, and then he starts to give an example. Wallace Wallace cuts him off like, you know. But the example was going to be about TV like TV, kind of, you know, brainwashing us at that time. And now it'll be the Internet fake news, right? So
And then something very nice that Huxley said. An interview is that
we humans.
and this applies to ever I mean anywhere. We humans were obsessed with power.
One of our biggest fashions is power. It can be big power, or it can be just you trying to. You would, you know, convince your brother or your sister of something?
It can be you trying to convince your parents. I mean, this is power people. So we are obsessed about trying to get to make it according to our to our own ways. Right? So this is part of the human nature, and that's Why, there is a very famous political social scientist, a political scientist.
Her name is Hannah.
I'm. Just right here for those of you who are in the
Hannah didn't just. I don't know how to pronounce her name actually, but it's I mean it's Hannah, and I mean in Portuguese. We say Hannah and I don't know in English, but it might be about the same. So she was a Jewish woman. Actually she escaped NASA when she she finished her life in the United States very famous call, or I think she was a pro at Chicago or something.
But anyway, she has a book where she talks about it. She's it's called for about the name of the book a Red. So it's been like over 20 years.
anyway. So we a cold human condition, or, if you are interested. Write me an email. Tell you I can. I can search that. But in this book, like in this book that it's one of her most famous book. She talks about humans as being political beings.
and and why political beings. Because it's about power. We crave power, right? We create power. We want to show people. I'm gonna show you who I am. You know you did that to me. I'm gonna give it back to you. It's all about power. So we we kind of crave that right? So
Oh, yeah, Jessica: yeah, Jessica here asking about the hostility in danger, I would say so. I mean, it's almost like Wallace is kind of a little bit brainwashed. He's he's blind. He doesn't see what's going on right like, and I can understand. I I have some and puffy for him, because that was 1950,
and and in the fifties and Huxley he was a man of so much ahead of his time right like even me. I think if I read that I mean you think about I mean, that interview is very futuristic.
You know it's unbelievable To think that that guy thought.
you know. You know he described things that are happening today, you know. So
okay, so, people here.
this is just a question for you.
and that's that. I also appeared in the interview.
Is freedom really necessary?
Do we need freedom?
And then I mean, this is a question I mean you could say, oh, we don't
you like people in brave new World. They are happy, and they don't have freedom. They have choice. They have some autonomy some choices. We thought that within the parameters, but they don't really have freedom. But my question for you and I mean, obviously this is not an exam question. This is for you to ask to think about. Do you think that? Is it necessary? I mean.
probably for those of you who at who saw the interview. You know what he said, but what matters to me now is what you say?
Where is everybody? I mean? Do you guys believe that is, do you think, I mean, think, think, think for a second.
you know. Is it really necessary, you know.
So it depends it on the definition of freedom like okay, Freedom means any removal of any kind of control, any kind of surveillance, any kind of you know, monitoring
joy like Jessica or everybody else. The removal of that's what they were talking about in this interview. The removal of any kind of surveillance, any kind of data, collection, any kind of monitoring.
is it? This is? It is is necessary. I mean.
yeah, we'll see, you know.
And that's exactly what Huxley said.
you know. Well, he was like, Well, you know. Yeah, for innovation. Yes. And why? Innovation is important, because that's how we that's how we transform society.
We through swarms, we humans. We transform this organization called society.
with our creativity, with innovation.
Again, you know we may. It's almost like you know we may. We can give up freedom.
but that would be. Let's suppose you are.
You are. Let's suppose you are a very right wing economist, and all you care about is capitalism and profitability.
You will love freedom. Because you're you're gonna say no. We need some freedom because you know it's freedom is an ovation. Innovation is profitability. I have an interview that I like a lot that I mean. It's not a that I have. It is on Youtube, but I have saved an interview with the
Steve Jobs, the guy from from apple.
And sometimes I play that interview in my class because the apple guy, Steve Jobs, he says, Look.
what is the secret of Apple? Because everybody wants to know what the secret is. This company is just like, you know. It's a huge company, I mean it's. This is an example for everybody, and then he says this: this: the secret is teamwork and collaboration.
And then people say, okay, elaborate. Then he says, through teamwork and and collaboration, we have brainstorming. We have diversity, and then we have innovation.
you know. So
so you know. So
again. So you feel, if you like the economy you want to make money. You're gonna appreciate some freedom, and if you are liberal, if you are on a liberal side of the political scale, you're going to appreciate some freedom, too, because you know. So, for different reasons, people might argue different reasons. But probably everybody's gonna say, yeah, it's necessary.
Finance is saying, I feel like freedom is the true sense can be scary given. Yeah, Well, it is, and people freedom is scary. It is scary. Think about little times where you know you had some. So well, I'm going to give you my example of the pro
when I tell people okay, like I've done this like very early on.
you know, in my career here in Canada. Then I I stopped doing that, but I would give kind of very open. It says it's like just right, me and say.
and people would freak out, and I that's why I stopped doing that because they students would complain to me that complain about me. They would give me a head. They they would call the you know, the the, the, the the chair, the department they would call the police on me. I am kidding, not the police, but like pretty much, almost like calling the police, because you know how. There, you don't give me parameters. You're not going to tell me what phone size I should be writing. You're not going to tell me what the caller phones, or whatever whatever whatever that I mean, you know, like, You know I I did that like twice when I first
I'm going to start teaching in 2,01617, and the of a this is just writing an essay on any topic.
and then people people are like, what is this a neighborhood departure? And you can't do that. And I understand, because the control is the bureaucracy. But I I you know, just to give you one example. So we freak out when we don't have parameters right like
Raj. I think it's necessary, because the ideal of freedom itself appeals to our very 5 as as as in nature as human beings. We all want to be able to do something we desire. Yeah.
yeah, I I I completely agree with you, you know.
Yeah, it should be some restrictions, Kathleen, saying, yeah, it's good, but with restrictions, Matthew
Major corporations they hate for. Oh, yeah, they do, because they want the Government to to control for them. That's why they lobby right, like. If you see the log of visiting. If you see the and i'm not kidding, you can go right now on Google and and pull the log
for for people who visit Congress in the United States. Like all the the members of Parliament, you're gonna see that top number one is Google. And then Facebook. Meta right, Facebook. You're gonna see all the big companies like lobbying with the State. So you're very right, you know. Yeah, you're right, Jessica.
Yeah, so it's it's kind of yeah. I I agree with you, Jessica. Here
in the chaos. Yeah, some some of salmon. Yeah, you know.
Oh, good. I'm. Gonna take that. Take note of that. The Burge.
Okay.
yeah, people, you guys are very right, and i'll see. I'm reading you here on the chat.
Yeah. Hj: again. And then, Matthew.
Yeah.
exactly. Yeah, you know it. It's true. You're very right, Matthew. When we we start to think how much surveillance we are, and then we start to think about freedom. I mean, we don't think about freedom until then, right like.
So let's see what else. Perhaps there should be surveillance.
Yeah, I agree. But, Lucy, you can't have you in English. We say I learned this a couple of years ago. You can't have your cake and eat at the same time, you know, Lucy doesn't go that way. That's the problem, you know.
because here there's a danger for that that kind of you know. You. Okay, let's now, you know. Do some DNA thing and then see who's gonna be a criminal? You can get crazy here, you know.
So but very nice, very insightful comment.
But you you're right, you know. I I wish that that would be possible without producing discrimination and re reproducing fascism in society. You know.
like Nazis and fascism.
Yeah, and you're right, Jessica. The real issue is the distinction between person and private public freedom. And that's the thing I mean, I think, for us people.
Thank you very much for your comments. I see here.
Oh, Valentine's also say he's talking about the birds, and it's really good. Okay, look people, you're very right for us. I mean, Obviously, we're not going to solve the problems of the world in this class. But what we want is to kind of, you know, is to to, you know, to. I want you guys to kind of think about those things, because if you are aware, I mean.
you know I I don't know for me at least I feel better about like knowing those things and knowing. Oh, this is this is this kind of surveillance and governance. Here's another kind here. That's what's happening here that's other thing happening. I mean, I feel more. I know, empowered.
Perhaps you know. Let me get my other slide. Hold on a second. Don't go anywhere because it's to have time, and we have another slide to go. So
this one here.
Where are you guys? Okay, Here
people get some coffee because we still have some stuff to cover. Okay. So i'm going to my second set of slides.
Let me see where that they are.
Okay.
Oh, gosh, where is it?
Sorry? Technical things here?
Okay. Here.
let's see if you see me. If you still see me. If you don't see me, please tell me. Okay. So if you don't see me.
Okay. So look what we're gonna do is
we're going to talk about the loose
in a, in a, in a chapter that's called postscript on the size of Control.
And then we're gonna start talking about full call, and I will finish who call next class. And why I'm gonna do that because I kind of knew that would be out of time.
and I want to cover full call in more detail, because for those of you who are going to do a masters degree in sociology, or in in in public health, or in in in both science or in anthropology, even, you know full call is a very important to offer. So I want to be more. You know I wanna you know. So
take a little bit of time. So next class we're going to finish fu call. We're going to do pretty much. Do Fu, go and start the privacy Chapter. Okay, the privacy part. Okay. So look
here. There is this article that I ask you to read it's called Postscript on the Societies of control that was publishing French in 1990
by a guy named Julie or Jill. However, you want to pronounce his name, feel comfortable with him because he has a very nice, you know. Text. So Joe or Gil Gil Giles. Okay, so that's his name or to lose. I don't know. However, you want to call it
so, and in English it was published in 1,982 in English, and then 1,995 again. So it became a very famous article in English. Okay, but ironically, a lot of the people we said surveillance. They don't know this.
Okay, they don't know this guy. I shall tell you that the and focal they were very good friends, they thought, at the same school in Paris, and they were actually good friends. Okay. So.
And they knew each other very well. Here's a picture for you. So this guy was born in 25. And he died in 1,995. I was 15 years old. So now you guys know that I was born in 1,980. So this guy, actually he has been to my country several times. You know. He's a very famous guy in both science, although I think that in in Canada. People in policy, science doesn't really study him, you know. I mean it's more like European kind of Paul Science.
Look.
if you see the the article that I gave you to read. It is organized into 3 parts 3 parts.
and I would like to kind of break it down for you, and to see how much time I have. Okay, Have 10 years. Oh, shoot.
Okay, people, Part Number one. He gives a little bit of a history
background for you. Okay? And then what he's gonna do in this part Part Number one is he's gonna make a distinction. Take note of that.
There is makes a distinction about, or between society, of sovereignty
and disciplinary society. Okay, and those concepts, those are actually concepts. Societies of sovereignty is a concept is a full coding concept and disciplinary society is another photon concept.
I know that by now you should expect me to give me the concept for call.
He has never written this concept. So he talks about it all over his books. So there is not like one single place where he defines. Okay, so i'm not going to give you a definition, because there is not one single definition. But there are ideas that are like you to kind of understand. So society of sovereignty
is the idea where it is a society where punishment.
And here you will read punishment as surveillance as control, as monitoring as data collection.
Okay, so remember, like you know punishment here in Foucault.
you know it's surveillance is monitoring data collection.
Why, i'm talking about full call, because in the list text he mentions who call. He creates a dialogue with full call. Okay, so look, punishment is visible, and it is cruel.
It is by an external figure.
you know, so that kind of punishment. That's really someone telling you what to do
kind of killing you in public for Foucault that is a society of sovereignty, Marcella. How about 1984. Would that be a society of sovereignty?
Yes, it would be kind of a mix. There is a lot of elements in that book that is, society of sovereignty, like the big, broader, punishing you and telling you what to do and and threatening you.
But there are also elements of us, a disciplinarian society. I'll get there before I see the chat look, so punishment is visible. The goal. Take note. I'm gonna ask this in the exam the goal of the society of sovereignty for full call is.
is is is to rule, that
is, to produce rulings on death, to decide who lives and who dies.
and also to text life. So it's almost like Look, Imagine the best image that I can give you is a queen or a king
faxing you telling you you're gonna die. I'm gonna chop your head in the in the guillotine, and French is guilty, I think, in English. The same word. I'm gonna chop your head, like, you know, and i'm gonna text you. So if you're producing something, i'm gonna i'm gonna you know charge tax.
So that's what like when we look at medieval Europe. That's the kind of society that we had like. You know the King, that doesn't like you, the Queen doesn't like you. They chop your head right? So i'm just see to check
and and think I your comment here, Jacob. Very good. So Jacob's talking about the amount of freedom in Canada.
Things are in order, you know. We do have like, you know, systems. We've problems, but overall, you know.
we have the law.
Yeah, I I you're very right, you know. And like, let's see how I also think that give away certain freedoms. Yeah, you have to give up. Yeah, I I see exactly what you're saying.
and you're I. I agree with you, and he goes. You go saying last and brave new world, but I think we need we need freedom with communication. I agree. I agree. I just want to bring something to you for you to think, Jacob very nice comment
like now, we always think about amount of freedom.
Try to think about types of freedom.
You know
me as a researcher. The more I do research and surveillance I I that always go for types like, okay? Is it about amount, or is it a but because, like what is too much in Canada can be too little elsewhere to little elsewhere. So it goes for the types, you know. It helps with the analysis. Okay.
I mean suggestion. Feel free to, you know, but a very nice comment.
and I have someone here saying.
You know something else, Jessica, You can read this message away.
Oh, gosh.
okay, Jessica. So control death and tax life. Exactly that. So I know that my time is always up.
I used to have 5 min. I was gonna use it. Yes, Jessica, you're right. So the the goal of sovereignty. Society is to control death or to you know, control that and text life. Look, I have this image here. I know it's kind of a little bit. Oh, my gosh! But just to kind of illustrate, this is the society
of sovereignty.
It's the idea of like, let's suppose I mean this guy here is just executing the order of some king, some queen, and very visible it. It's very cruel right like public execution, public execution, like you know, or like. I don't know if you guys know, but like in Europe in medieval times.
the only people who are allowed to hunt. Obviously, at the time there was no supermarket, so people had to hunt.
The only people allowed to hunt was the members of the royal family and the clergy members of the church. If someone who was a common, an ordinary person, was caught hunting, that person would be killed.
Imagine: i'm talking about medieval times. Is not that long ago. Okay, so that society was society of sovereignty
Again, let me use my little time that I have.
And then we have. We have a disciplinary society also by full call in disciplinary society punishment. And again, punishment means surveillance, monitoring governance data collection. It's no longer a spectacle. It's not about torturing people in a visible way.
Punishment it becomes a different kind of power.
Okay, but myself, tell me what exactly what kind of power it's called discipline.
So you punish. Punishment is no longer violence against people, or texting or or killing people. But punishment means disciplining people. Okay.
and and all the disciplining happens according to the law to the bureaucracy, to rules right? So there is a whole system and control
control like governance. It happens through an environment of constraints and
privations, challenges, you know, obligations, prohibitions. It's almost like you know. It's like almost like a true one. Show where you put some, you know, obstacles, some constraint, some privacy. I don't know if you guys saw this movie. It's a old move. Truman show like it's this guy that lives in a kind of you know, made up a fake
stage. It kind of life, and he doesn't know that he's in a stage of life. So it's like, you know this is the environment where there's the deprivations, constraints, controls, prohibitions, and and you know that's the how the control happens, you know, and the goal. I'm going to finish. I'm going to wrap up here the goal
of disciplinary society is to organize life. Look
it, contrast. One is to, you know, rule, control life. The other one is to organize you. Don't cure. No, everybody lives. Everybody, you know, is gonna be alive here. There's no people being killed, you know, but the goal is to organize that life.
And when there, when did we transition from
the side of sovereign, she, just society of to the Disciplinary Society? We did that transition in the in the eighteenth century.
Okay, according to full call.
and that the according like the actual event, empirically speaking, was the creation of the criminal code in France. Okay, the creation, and then the the reforms like there was a series of reforms, you know, of the criminal code. So that's where he puts it like, empirically speaking. Okay.
So look, that's what I'd like you to keep for now. So again we are not talking. We're talking about full call, but because the Lewis brings that up. So you know. So keep this in mind, for now there will be a third type of society
which is called Societies of control. And this is the idea of the loose. So Foucault had the idea to science of sovereignty, disciplinary society. And then the loose came up with a new type of society called Society of Control
Societies of Control and Surveillance Governance is always different. Okay.
so is this clear people.
We're going to pick it up from this slide next week. Okay.
let me see. So I think that's it for today. I would like to thank you very much. You guys have a nice nice
afternoon or evening. If you have any question, please don't go away with questions. Stay here. Check with me. I'm here for you. Okay, let's cause yeah. So we're gonna to. We're discussing the loose. And then next class we're going to do an opticism. Okay, Kathleen delays today, starting and then
an opticism. I will catch up because I do have space in the syllabus to catch up. So don't worry about it. We're gonna get there. But is it making sense to you. Let me know. Here
you guys have. Oh, yeah, Have a wonderful weekend people.
You guys take care. Have a wonderful weekend. Let's just stop sharing with stop recording.
So.
"












Jan 24

"Hey, folks, Welcome back to sociology. 2 to 6. Do you hear me? Do you see me? Well.
okay, so that's great. Okay. So let's start. So, first of all, let me just say a few words about the exam.
My exams. They are usually easy
and easy means what it means that I test.
I I test like the like staff from from the readings, and also from the lectures.
but it usually is that overlap. I go, like you know, because I mean the way that I I try to do My lectures is like. I know those readings that you guys are reading, and I I try to summarize them to you. A threat to, you know, to kind of, you know, like amplify or highlight whatever is important. And then those are the things that i'm going to be testing you on on. So I don't do. I do not do those things such as I go into reading, and then I find something deep, deep, very specific, down there. And I ask you that.
Okay? So I don't do that kind of stuff. So you know. So my questions. They always go back to the content that that was, you know, that was covered in class so quite often People ask me. Is it enough just to kind of sit in class, and then i'm going to test. Well.
I would say that if Don't do any any reading, and it just come, and and you know it. It depends. If you have a lot of good notes, I mean, if you actually took notes and you've understood correctly, maybe you know you can get away with that. But ideally you should kind of read, and if it's too much for you, what you're gonna do is when you're reading.
Try to kind of okay. Oh, she said this in class. Oh, she she brought this up, and then, you know, so kind of like, you know.
focus on whatever you know I am discussing class. Is this clear to you guys to have any question about the exam. So usually my people, they don't really complain about it, you know, like they say over I was fair fair game like that's what I hear a lot, you know. But let me see If you guys have questions.
don't hesitate to put your question up there, or you know, or put in the chat.
No, no, no class, no. Our Our first exam.
It's going to be February. Not not yet. Okay. Yes, exactly, Grace. Thank you very much. Fab: 16. Okay. So you don't have an exam to then.
Is that okay? Okay, Any more questions People are concerned. Honestly.
again, you know, use my lectures as a guideline, you know.
or to study like kind of, you know, if you get to something very specific and or something that I did not touch in class touch on in class, i'm not going to ask anything that relate to that, you know.
and if because usually what I do is once I finish preparing the exam, I I kind of read the exam. And I I kind of ask myself, Marcel, is this fair?
Does it conform and comply to whatever you said in class? If I find something in there, that's kind of more specific. That was like more in the reading, and was not so much in class. I actually tell people I I send you guys an email. Say, look, you know, mind whatever like, you know, if there's something i'll, I'll I'll let you know. And and ironically, even when I tell people a lot of people that just don't care, and they come back to me later. Oversell this. You never said this in class yet, but I do remember. Check! Check your mailbox. You're going to find something for
for me, and then they go back and say, oh, yeah, i'm sorry I forgot, or I didn't see it, you know. So you know communication people in honesty and integrity. This is kind of you know. I appreciate that so, and I expect that. So I I appreciate that from my side, you know.
No, I would not do a review session, Jessica. But I will write you an email kind of outlining the main topics. Kind of kind of you know, kind of. You know, within this topic that you have to study. I will kind of, you know, gear you a little bit more re size. So you don't have too much travel. Okay.
it's kind. I mean, it's no Valencia. Those questions that you see on the classes. Just simple questions for the the whole course. Okay.
let's see. There's this is already been answered for a month. Exam: okay. The first Exam: a lily. First exam is multiple choice, and the last one is multiple choice. And then you have an assignment.
Okay.
so multiple choice, multiple choice.
And you do have some simple questions for you.
Not necessarily. Some of them, I mean. No. Those simple questions I cover them in, i'm. Covering them in class.
Actually, they are all in class.
Any other question people concerned, I mean, share your concern. Don't. Don't take your concern at all.
Don't. Take your concern home, because if you do that, it gives stomach, cake, headache, and eventually depression. So just throw it out here. So you you know. So you're going to go home concern free. You know
you you again. You have to study. You have to take notes, but there's no like, you know it's not like a class that it's too hard, or that you know that I make it like You know, my goal here is to actually transfer the knowledge that I have to you, and in a clear fashion, in a way that you actually learn. So that's the goal. So okay.
if you have any question about the exam, you throw in there. I'll go back that later.
So last time we met, so we we we. We saw some literature on on surveillance.
and now we are going more to the social science literature, and we were discussing last time this guy named Jill. He is a French scholar. He was friends with full call. Okay.
And today we're gonna see full call. But like, let's just finish covering the lose. Okay. So here, less less time we met. I told you that we have 3 types of society. Okay, 3, to take note of that, because that will be on the exam, 3 types of society. So we have societies of sovereignty.
And this is an invention by who? By delays, No, by football. Actually, okay. So Society of sovereignty and we have something that Fuko also pointed, and it's called disciplinary Society. Okay. So what is the difference? What is the difference between those 2 society? Take note of that difference? So in society, in sovereignty, science or society of sovereignty. Power is visible, punishment is visible. Surveillance is visible.
Okay, and it is a society that that has 2 main goals. It it it'd be, create it, create rules on death. So it decides when people are killed and it takes life. You guys remember that from next last class is it clear for you. Can I go ahead.
Tony. I'll get you exam again later. Let's just move ahead, and then I talk about the exam again. Okay. So you guys are okay. So far, society of sovereignty.
Can we go on? Okay, Good. So disciplinary society, it is a society that's different, that instead of like regulating that
it manages. Take note of that verb manages life and death
in that society of the Disciplinary Society. You don't get rid of anybody. You don't kill people. What you do is you manage life? Okay? So how do you manage? I mean, you create an environment. You use bureaucracy. You can create rules to manage people.
Okay. So this society, according to like to full call, not the list, but according to full code. The last year is just doing a summary of Foucault. So in disciplinary societies, according to full call, I mean they were born they those societies They appeared
in the eighteenth century. We're going to see more about how those sites appeared, and how to kind of, you know, quotes custom, but so far so good, so in in power, in disciplinary societies is is
power in disciplinary societies. It's, it's called discipline.
It's not like a power that that goes in your face that torches you and punishes you. No, it is a power that like makes you comply somehow. So this kind of power creates an environment just like a playground, you know. Think of a playground an environment that controls you.
you know. So it makes you jump and makes your client and makes you go down. You know it's almost like an that kind of environment, and that environment controls you
and and surveillance in that in that society as joy is invisible. Okay, however, we're going to talk more about the visibility in visibility. Kind of type of me. But yes, surveillance is more invisible, and also it's more
self kind of you know it's it's it's self censorship. So you know what you have to do. We talked about that because I mean the literature in the novels that we discussed Revenue world especially. It's more like that. Okay, so far, so good. Can I go ahead? People? Can I go ahead? People.
yes or no, but only chat for me clear so far, 2 types of society. Yes, Jessica, you're right. Okay, I see you here. You're good. So look
now. This is this picture. Here's just to kind of illustrate society of sovereignty by full call. It's this idea that you know someone is kind of just making decisions on life, on, on, on, on death. Okay when to kill someone. So so you keep in mind, Marcella. Is there a picture for Society of discipline?
Disciplinary Society Know that? Well, I didn't. I didn't. I will give you one later. But if I if I am to give you a picture, I would actually put a playground for you.
you know, if you guys could.
if you had to replace my picture instead of a playground for societies of discipline, what would you put? What image do you think that would kind of illustrate a society that is a society they wanted the second one here, you know a society and disciplinary society.
Come on, People in the chat. Think quick school probably. Yes, school would work.
you know, if you if you want to go broader a little bit. What kind of I mean, you know, I mean give me a kind of more broader kind of picture like, you know I I gave you playground. You guys gave me school. What else
Society about science. Then it's too broad, right, like too broad like you could workplace, maybe. Yeah. But give me something more concrete concrete that you can actually touch, you know.
Come on, folks.
we gotta move. So I want to expedite you
6 streets potentially. Yeah. But give me something even more kind of obvious, like, you know.
plagiarizing. Probably. Yeah, something like that kind of social order, you know. You could give me a camera if you want.
Perhaps I I I wonder what you know? I would give you a camera
because the camera is that idea that I mean it's there. The camera changes your behavior. You know that you are being under surveillance. A traffic light will be a nice one, you know. You know that you have to stop.
I mean, obviously, there is always surveillance, but you know that you have to stop sports team. Well, yes, because there is competition. There is data collection. There is monitoring, you know. Speed speed trap. Yes, okay, you guys got it. I'm happy that, you know. You know you got what i'm talking about. Okay, so look
So
So again. So so like. Now, like we are getting more to what you know like the most to lose. He came up
with an additional kind of society, the third one. The third one was by the list, the first, the second was by foul, and the third was by Liz. So the Liz. What he said was that you know what we have today.
It's not this in his interpretation. It's not disciplinary societies, just like Foo call, said he, said. No, people. You know what for Court told us.
It's it's behind us already. We already have another kind of society, and he labeled Take note of that. He labeled that society societies of control.
Okay, so what is the difference difference between the 2 of them? The which 2 of them, the disciplinary society and the assign of control. So for for full call
in a disciplinary society, what you have is a bunch of institutions. This the family, the school, the workplace, the hospital, you know, like like many institutions, the government and those institutions, they are what he called spaces of enclosure.
So it's almost like that. You move from institution. One you go to you. You move from this institution to the second institution, to the third institution, to the fourth institution, and in the end, but within inside of those institutions you are being controlled.
So control is kind of it. It's side. So taking out of that control is tied to the institutional setting. Okay, so
meaning that when you change from one institution to the other institution, you you change the control apparatus.
Basically, is it clear for you guys? So far, so you go from family. You have one type of control, and then you move to the school. You have another kind of control, and then you go to the workplace. You have another kind of control. Okay, so that's that's like, for that is what is for full call. Okay for disciplinary societies.
And then what to to this is gonna tell us is that Look, this is behind us. This is Bs already. Now, what we have is side of control. You.
e. When you like. What we have now is, you go from institutional one to institution, 2, 3, 4, 4, and then the control never stops. It is continuum.
There's a you know. It's continuous
as well.
So it's not like like it's not. It's not on team. You all look in English. We have those 2 words: Here.
check the chat. Here we have the worry on Tina Wall, and we have the word on team new us. So one is continual, another one is is continuous because it never stops. So that's what the Lewis said about today's society.
So you, you you guys gave me a bunch of examples to you straight. You know a a, a a disciplinary society. Give me now some image, a concrete image, to illustrate a society of control where you know where control is continuous. Give you some image that could illustrate that
Sasha. Yes, they are up.
They are, you know. Don't need their only class. Let's see what people say. Internet Yes, Valencia. Wonderful, wonderful people you got. You got it. Look
cell phone, Internet. You know.
you know the online world, You know, I would give you one right here. I'll give you 1 one example right here.
Credit card
credit card.
This is like continuous. I can. I can spend money at your way at workplace like the canteen. It doesn't matter. I can go to, You know, France, Brazil. You know Japan, China and continuous control here. Okay.
So I think that the list probably was kind of right. So if we're gonna do kind of a evolution of society, we start with the of with an image, let's say, of the king, the king, science who dies and who lives, and then the next one we can use the camera, and then the next one. We can use the Internet if you want to. Kind of, you know, plot kind of a chart.
You know what I mean like. So you can see the evolution of how society transformed over the years.
Is that clear? People?
I need this to be like. I need you to know this thing, and I need you to know this thing in a way that you know you're going to be able to talk about and explain that to someone
good to our willingness. It is usually Jessica for Jessica's question.
In both societies, like disciplinary societies and science of control. We we are willing to get to give our information. Okay, usually.
And but in society of a sovereignty we are not willing, you know. There, there is not like, you know there is no trade off. But in this those 2 kinds of society more modern, I mean, we are, you know there is like their Perks. There are advantages in giving up the information.
Yeah, I mean, Grace, you're I mean, if you, if you kind of zoom in very kind of close, yeah, you could make this argument that the credit card is not continuous, but the idea is that i'm being monitored all the time. I mean, I might not be using the credit card right now, but the the bank
is monitoring me at all the time. So if I use that any point in time, the bank will know, because it's it's being monitored, you know.
like even like it. But but you guys get a grier like rear like it. It's the same logic. I mean, yeah, I get you guys, if you come very close in your analysis you can say no more salad. This is continual.
However, the bank
there there there is people there are systems 24 by 7 at the bank monitoring what I'm doing with my card, even if my cards just my wallet right like
exactly joy. This is one of the differences. Okay, you're right, is one of them. That control is not in one particular institution. Control is just everywhere.
Yeah, the people I love your questions, your comments, you know.
Yeah. So I keep keep flowing. This i'm gonna keep pushing because we need to move, because I now i'm starting to get concerned. So look so. What we have is that kind of in in? Look at. Look at my slide here. Don't know if you can see my my cursor. But like in societies of control, you know what you have is that is the ultra ultra rapid forms of free floating control. So control is just like, you know, all the time kind of going.
So look the logic behind his argument. Look at the logic. So I mean just like it here, what he's doing. Because, look, I organize my slides in the same way that he organized his article, so I can explain the I to you, and then it's easier for you to read right. So so the logic is like. It's actually a section in the article. So here in the Under logic, what he does is what the Liz does is that he explains better how this whole thing works. So he says, Look in in societies, in disciplinary societies.
What we have is like. It's almost like we. Our information we like we are independent variables, and the whole point or the control itself.
is an independent, variable. It is sort of analogical. And then in a society of control it becomes a a modulation. Okay, so
so like like the the the the enclosures, like the the enclosures in a society like the institutions. If he's calling institutions, enclosures, so the institutions in a society of control, you know they are still distinct. They look distinct. We have the family, the school. But what we have is, you know there's this modulation within them. Okay.
So so think about even like, you know when we look back at society, think about how the workplace changed at people
before we used to have salaries or wages, and we still have salaries and wages. However, now we also have bonuses now, so it's like the idea of a bonus is almost like this modulation that you like. Once I tell you. You look there's a bonus for you like before was
you? Leave your house and you leave your family, and you go to work. Okay in the disciplinary society.
and then that's it. You finish work. You go back home, and that's it. Now, I tell you. Look, there is that bonus
I'm going to pay you some bonus, and then what do you do.
you now? Your. You take that work, that separation between family and work? It's gone. You know the very idea of upon us makes you kind of. You know that control
is in your hand all the time. So you go back home, and you're going to talk to your part. You're going to discuss something you said. No, I should some work now, because you know I wanna I want to get my bonus. Do you guys get what i'm saying? I'm just seeing the chat, because I know you guys are pumping like there. Let me see. So
yes, modulation, Jessica. Yes, I mean again, the here it's not very clear. Correct? Okay. You could, Jessica interpret modulation as an incentive.
Well.
I also as an incentive, but Not only, you know, modulation is the control, and the the incentive is a form of control as well. So you know, I know that you are looking for very clear cut answers, but you know it's it's like social science. So here there's a little bit of interpretation, but it can be interpreted in that way. Okay.
Yeah. So Grace, what I said was that, you know, like disciplinarian society's control was kind of analogical, you know, if you want to make a kind of he's doing like philosophy here. This guy's a philosopher actually. So he's using kind of funny words, so he's saying it's on a logical like old kind of telephones, not like the digital kind of telephone that we have now. So he's saying, One kind of control is on a logical and a lot of means. It's kind of binaries, 0, and one, you know. That kind of when we look at computing is a very kind of clear kind of obvious kind of
control that starts and stops starts in stock. That's what he meant. And then modulation is that kind of control that never stops so blurring the separation between exactly that Kathleen Surveillance surveillance
blurs that separation completely. And now that you guys are thinking, probably you're gonna say, yeah, I can see I can see. Look when I, when I have this credit card here with me when I have my credit card, you know, like
there is no separation between my house.
You know this is from Brazil. Actually this credit cards from Brazil, but I can use it anywhere. So there is no separation between my home Brazil, my country. Brazil, my country, Canada, my home in Canada, the bank, you know, the restaurant in Canada, the restaurant in Brazil. It doesn't matter, because I mean I can use it anywhere, and the bank is controlling me anywhere. Okay.
So let me just go back in here.
So let me just highlight some stuff in here so well that that those parts that I have on this slide for you is just like, you know, for you to kind of. When you go and read. You pay attention to that. So he talks about also training. Think about training. Training. Used to be something that belongs in this school system.
Only students used to do training in disciplinary societies. Now, training is something that you have to do your entire life. And again, and you do training at home. You do training at work, you do training in the school system. So I mean.
you know it's almost like, you know. Training is kind of evidence of this, this new form of control, and you have to do it. You know that I mean it's all almost like goes like self censorship you. You, you know that you gotta do that? Okay, for you to kind of, you know, do well in life
mostly important. Look. Ds: he means disciplinary society, so mostly imported here people in disciplinary societies. The power power controls individuals and messes so look
like we have a a form of power, you know. Let's say, a camera that can control the individual and can control many people together. This Isn't Disciplinary Science in societies of control. What we have is, it is a some sort of control that individuates you.
It is individualizing.
So it it it's almost like before, was one person versus many people.
Right so now we don't have that dichotomy anymore. Now, one person
and many people like it's almost like
I can. I am able now with the technology that is available to us. We are able to control many people, but in that individualizing way it can be like it could be the population of China. 1.4 billionpeople, and that's why i'm gonna give you some Chinese example. I mean you can. You can be work with us a huge population, and you can have controls in place that actually individualizes each and every person in that population of 1.4 billionpeople.
Okay. So
let's see here.
people. I'm just an advanced a little bit, and then I go. I go. I go back to the chat. Okay. So look.
if you want to think about the economy in disciplinary societies. The economy is about raw materials and machines. So we have.
we change, we transform raw materials, we trust like, and then we have machines, and in in parts are assembled, and then we have, like something like a a a product, a commodity. And when it comes to, you know when it but like now I mean it. It it's almost like oh, sorry, sorry people! Sorry I said something here in disciplinary societies. It's about raw materials being transformed so just like the economy kind of in the before 1980 S.
So in in in, in in societies of control, what we have is this idea of everything is go globalized, and then parts are are flowing from one country to another country, and they are being assembled. So what I said about the assembled is, it belongs in the society of control. Okay.
corporations think about corporations, corporations. They they they are everywhere, and they work as a orchestrated kind of entity, controlling everything
right. Think about Apple. Think about, you know, Walmart, think about those big corporations like the top 10 largest corporations in the world, which they have, like, you know, like a huge share of the world. Gdp: right? So just to think about the economy, because he talks a little bit about the economy. So and then he says, look
like there's a third part of the third and last part of his like article that he talks about the program. So he talks a little bit about the logic of how those 2 societies work disciplinary versus Society of Control. And then he talks about the program. So he's gonna see, he's gonna say look
like here. So it's almost like
like societies of control. They look like science fiction.
Is this idea that you are being cultural, that it looks like brave new world. So it it looks like, okay, everything is under control. Everything's clean, Everything is organized, I mean, and it's so funny, because perhaps now, with the pandemic
we we kind of. We have more kind of it. It's easier to visualize. It's almost like scientific. You can. You know we're all together here in this screen. I mean, you know I don't know if you guys are kind of understanding what i'm trying to convey. But it's it. It gets like you know, like control is everywhere, you know. You go, for you go out in the streets, and then, you know, and then
you move from one place to another place, and from one person to another person, and there's no barriers, I mean, you know there's no like, you know. It's all very fluid control became extremely fluid, and the pandemic kind of accelerated that. So let me just see here.
hold on! Let me just see the chat because I I wanna
Okay. So what is missing here?
I kind of I kind of.
I think, Valencia modulation, and I think an example of modulation. Yes, Valencia. Yes, you know you're you're correct. And see here, Jessica, Ds. Would would would be civilians because you don't want to.
No, no. There when he talks about raw materials. He talks about the economy itself, because I mean, he makes a link between surveillance and protection. Okay, because people think with me, I know that you guys are coming from both science and everything. But try to think from the business perspective. I mean, think about the amount of surveillance that goes in the workplace for
goods, commodities to be produced. Okay. So like the way that we produce things change it. Once surveillance changed the way that we produce things changes. So now we can produce things all over the world because we can. You know we are able to track. We are able to monitor before we couldn't do that. We didn't have that technology. Okay.
yes. And also there is this aspect of transforming us into into docile kind of compliant workers.
curfew and hours and get back.
Exactly it, Grace. This is a perfect example. Curfew and Quebec.
Okay among among Thank you for your question there. Very good. I's asking us about code and signature. Yes, in society of in society, of in, in in disciplinary societies.
e. We like, since we would have to sign everything was a signature.
you know, like we didn't have people. It's just because you guys are too young. But we didn't. We didn't have the idea of password. The idea that you need a password, a code, a password, is a code. The idea that you need a password, something very new, like when I was a kid. It was signatures everywhere, and then slowly became all about, you know, like even like the bank system before it was like checks. You would have to sign the check, and now you know, All of a sudden they came cards, and then there's a password so so like the the theers say, look in in disciplinary and societies. They have
signatures.
and and and now we have codes. It's almost like we. I'm no longer my signature. I am a code, you know that I type in for everything right? So it's almost like we humans we are. We are reduced to a number. Okay.
Yeah, okay. So we wouldn't be the wrong. No, but the exactly he's talking about the transformation. Yeah, it's exactly all the surveillance that is behind, you know, like the way that we produce things, including work, work, work, workplace, surveillance on workers, people. So far, so good. Or you you guys are thinking she's delusional.
Come on, everybody. I want to hear people who don't really talk a lot on the chat. So
are you guys following, or you are like? Oh, this is the delusion. I can't follow what she's trying to say.
Okay. So
okay, so look
just for us to wrap up here a little bit more information for you.
So, according to the loose in societies of control. We don't really have enclosures anymore. So, for example, he talked about enclosures, so he says the list says No, in the of controls.
It's not about enclosures. It's about continuance. So what we have is a bunch of continuums, things that they never and nothing ends. Okay, so and it's all like prison, and I really like this is at the end of the text. I really like some of those ideas here. He says that Look.
prison, do. The prison is a very old kind of idea.
It's almost like it's a very old kind of institution.
It's almost like we don't need reason anymore.
you know, like he's making philosophy people right. He's not saying like, Open up the gates. No, he's making philosophy, so he say, Look! Because we are under control all the time.
and you know.
and we now have electronic callers for prisoners. So potentially in the future, we're not going to have that institution anymore, like concrete, concretely speaking, you know. Because
why we're gonna keep people in jail, you know, and and pay so much money. I mean, each person costs about like $120,000 per year, you know, in Canada the Federal system, I mean. Why, you're gonna keep people in jail if there's there like digital ways to control someone and different ways to end. They unable someone
right like to disable someone like in the you know, like that. You kind of make that person you restrain, because reasons about restraining right like. So we we now have other ways to restrain people. So maybe in the future before I die before we die. We're gonna see, you know.
So prison chain school the same.
It's like, you know.
School changes that I mean. School used to be something. Now it's in big. I I see my students everybody. Everybody is kind of stressed.
It's almost like school became kind of a form of work.
So you guys are super young, but you are as stressed as any any worker, any employee, because it it. It never ends right like it never ends. You finish your bachelor's degree, and then you're not done. I am free. I'm! Finally out of prison, and then, all of a sudden you have to do your masters, your Phd. And then you have to do your your clinical degree, your whatever it's, never ending right like hospitals. You know, he says, that perhaps one day we're gonna have. We're gonna create some sort of hospital that has no doctors
or patience, and it's 20, because now we see that there is a huge movement for, like for digital kind of forms of medicine where you know it's all through the camera, you know. And so so what he wrote. He wrote this in the 90 S. It's almost like becoming a reality, right? So
i'll get you in it in a bit, Jessica. So people i'll get back to those questions that you guys have. Let me just move.
So how do we?
How do?
Oh.
It's my question. Here is my my my question is missing. I have to fix this slide.
But how do we here's missing, and we how do we resist?
Just a side of control, and that's my question for you. Where is the chat? Let's see.
Jessica. Go back to your question later. But tell me, how do we.
if you want to resist, because, like you know, in the disciplinary society, if you want to resist, you can make a strike.
If you want to resist in the workplace you can strike. If you want to resist you can. You know you can, you can. You can do something to the teacher you can ask. You can get the teacher, the teacher, the pro for, like you know, dismissed.
but, like you know, because the like, the teacher represents a form of control, you can dismiss that form of control. But how do you resist in a society of control?
Yes, Greer, exactly that. I mean. I see that loss of humanity, you know.
Yes, Jessica refused to participate. Maybe I mean, I'm kind of putting you guys to think, because this is a hard question. How do you? How do we resist. Because even what I want you guys to think actually is like the ways in which we resist is becoming sort of outdated.
You guys see that I mean the ways that we use to do like barricades, you know. You, you know, like you fire up some, you know, tires, and you do bar barricades that doesn't work anymore.
you know.
So
how do we do? Right? So
yeah, exactly, someone you're right like in some countries you can't. But like in those countries where you can. How do you do it, You know.
Yeah, being aware, prop knowledge, maybe you know.
Yeah, quite. I I jess that you're right, quite quiet, which became like something very like, you know, like walking away from your workplace. Yeah, maybe. How about how about school? So schools and other things? So, people, let me give you some more in in perfect example.
I told you that in a society of control.
you know, like it's almost like, you know control is, it individuates you so it, like surveillance, is able to capture you.
It's almost like all of us. We have an individual side, and we have a collective side.
We are individuals, but we belong to groups. Do you agree with me?
We're all individuals, but we belong to groups, school, church, hockey, game, whatever hockey, you know. Sports, I mean, we belong to groups. So I would like to give you here. Go back to that stuff that I studied in China called Household Register, which already gave you some. You know one of my lectures. I talked about that because I want to show you
how this household register controls you as an individual.
your individual side, and also your collective side.
So this is kind of a like, you know. People say, oh, this is like, not high tech. Yeah, but it it's extremely powerful. It is a form of control that now is high tech because it has been digitized. So look. I want to go back here to my lecture very quickly, so i'm gonna take you to China
is just to refresh you. And so you kind of see empirically know what I'm trying to say.
Look
again. This is an example of a surveillance mechanism in a society of control. Okay. So the type of society that they lose talks about. So look, this is like, Imagine this is a kind of family Id
imagine. Let's suppose that you guys you you have a family. So this is an Id for your family. He has your
type of household. It classifies, if you are from like Edmonton, Rural or Edmonton urban
it. It gives a house household number for you. It gives you your household address, and it collects data on your address on whoever is the household head usually might be, you know, if this is like China, it would be your father, you know, and lists all the household members, meaning your your siblings, and then for each member it has all those information.
Take a quick look. Just go over this list here very quick. Just go over the list.
Look, look at. Look, look at the amount of data.
Okay. So imagine. So. Each family has a little booklet, and you know, and that's it so. And now you think that
because this booklet
he has information of each household member.
and this booklet is managed by the Government, the Government is able to pinpoint
each and every person in that society that society in China, so like the government, is able to kind of literally pinpoint like this, is you in a very kind of individualizing way, but also the Government is able to see who your family is.
and people think. With me family is the one of the most important, if not the most important institution in society.
Okay, it's. It's the basis of society. Like it. It's where society starts. So so you know the Government is able to see you as a an individual being
and as a collective, like your individual side and your collective side
Is this clear?
Let me see if this is clear, because
oh, gosh, you guys are chatting there, I mean, not chatting like you. You have a lot of good com. It's just like too much for me to follow and and teach at the same time.
Yeah, we're okay, yeah, okay, Sarah, let me see if there is an actual
yeah, you guys are all right. What I see here. It's it's good stuff, you know.
Okay. So you guys, okay, so any questions so far. Are you following me. So you know.
Okay. So here, look, let me tell you how this starts in China. So in China
you are born in China, and then you know. That means that your parents they have to go to the police station. They have to register you, and that means that you're gonna have. If this is that booklet
you're gonna have. There will be a page for you. So there will be one extra page for you with all your information. Okay? And then when you turn 16, or even earlier, people apply for an Id for you like you're gonna have your own. Id just like in Canada, and then you know your photo is fed into that system. So the Government now has your Id number to and your photo. Okay, that is what that means. That like, Not okay. Now you are 16. You're gonna need to buy a a cell phone because that's what everyone
but it does, right. So you need a a cell phone, or even earlier before that. And then your parents for you to get that that that the the chip, like the telephone cheaper ship
like for you to get that ship you need you. You need to have your id. So you go to a place, you know, some like kioski on a shopping mall or some kiosk on on the streets, and then you ask for a telephone number, and then you buy your telephone number, and then the person who sells at you? They're gonna ask. Look! Can I have your Id please? And then you're gonna give
them your Id, and that means that they're gonna now tie your telephone number also goes inside of that data set. So now the Government has has this data set with all information about you, your family, and including your Id and your telephone number. Okay. So look.
And then that means what for you to go on the Internet.
You know, in China, I mean if I don't if you ever visit China, but for you to go on the Internet, in China, I mean, you need to have an a a a a, a a chip with a telephone number that was purchased in China. So if you're gonna use your your Canadian cell phone it doesn't work. So I won't Be surprised if people here tell me all I was in China like just connect connection for Thailand and you know I could not access the Wi-fi: yeah, because the wi-fi identifying that we have a foreigner number and won't allow you to go to on the Internet because they entered the all
like the entire control on the Internet side to your cell phone number, which is tied to your Id, which is t to your family people. It doesn't take it doesn't need to to be too much smart for you to understand that if you screw up and you say anything on the Internet that is kind of
complex or or like deviant, You know. You know the Government will know who you are, like they individualizing kind of power, and also who your family is.
and they're gonna be able to play that all don't do that because you have a family and you will do self self censorship, self surveillance because you're gonna say, i'm not gonna do this strip thing, because if I do this stupid thing on the Internet that's gonna compromise my entire family. Do you guys follow me. What I just try to, you know. Let me see on the chat again.
So one more thing in China for you to get any kind of act, any kind of email, any kind of
Internet thing. You need to have a telephone number. Why? Because that's exactly where
the control is. So you cannot sign up. We follow the number you cannot use. We chat. This is like not easy. It's just like a a gmail kind of you know. Let's look just like a free mail account. You know a ball, you know, just like the Twitter, I mean. You can't go, and you know. And again, so that kind of control, because we have
an individuating kind of control, individualizing kind of control plus a control that controls you in the collective. It makes you con continuously think about your individual self and your collective, the group where you belong, which is the family.
Okay, so let me see here.
So
okay, this is making. Yeah, it's. It is scary to something. Yeah, it is making sense. So far, okay, good. So this is
some things.
Yeah. So that is that that happens in China all the time. Okay? So why I'm give you the China example. Because I wanted to give you kind of an empirical example of what it looks like. You know this kind of continuous control. It's continuous people.
Okay, that this is actually it. I'm not it. This is not fiction, I mean, this is not a novel. Now this is actually a country right? So, and like they, co Covid.
it made that, even, you know, because now, like the government in China, for example, they are controlling Covid through your cell phone. So you know you like there, like the Government access.
let's suppose, like they see your your contact list, all the people that you have in your contact list
and the government tracks you like because they can see where you are. I mean, cell phone calls for that like the GPS, right? So they can see all you know. Valencia, Mant, Marcella and Marcella Head, Covid. How do they know, because everything is linked like even like your your hospital files, they are linked back to your, to your Id, which are linked back to your cell phone number so like, so the Government can tell. Okay, Valencia. She went for coffee yesterday with Marcella and then Marcella.
Today in the morning she got a diagnosis of Covid. Okay. So that is what the Government sends Valencia a message, Valencia. It's time for you to quarantine
quarantine, because you know, you met Marcella yesterday, and she had Covid and all. Therefore it means that you're gonna have Covid, you, you know. So it became like Covid in China. It took it to the next level. And probably now you guys understand, because in Canada there was a huge push against those health apps that were like, you know, tracking Covid cases, you know
so
so essentially what we have here in China is a surveillance assemblage. It's like, you know. We have the household Register, which is this thing that I introduced to you right? This it looks very innocent. But again, remember, this thing has been digitized.
so it looks very innocent, has been digitized. So we have the household register. Now you have cameras refer to fish intelligence. You have the phone number helping you have Internet access being monitoring. You have the Id that helps you. A photo provides a phone. So it's like this whole assemblage you have. This is just to give you a few examples. There is much more than that. Right? Look.
I would like you later. I would like you later to watch this video that I have for you here.
The link to the video is underneath this slide on the notes.
I you must watch Why? Because I will put a question about this video on the exam. So go and watch. If you watch the the the carefully. I just listen. Watch it's just like I don't know
couple of minutes like, you know
it is gonna show you. You know how this whole thing works, and it's gonna show you that you know the police in China, even if we're talking about a huge city with like 7 10 millionpeople. If you do something wrong, they are able to identify you, because again they have cameras everywhere. They zoom in
a camera with artificial intelligence. They get your face very quickly. They process your face. They know who you are. They know your family. They know your address. They know everything about you. They find you in a matter of seconds, like minutes minutes. So look at this video because you're gonna see that it takes like 7 min 7 min for the guy to be found, you know, like. So take a look at this
so obviously for this level of surveillance in a society of control to work. What we need is big data.
Do you guys see the connection surveillance big data. Now, I mean, you need huge computers with like
an astronomical capacity to process data.
And that's why China, us Japan, Germany. They are the the countries in the world that they are racing to create supercomputers. Why do they need super computers? Because, again, it's in this astronomical amount of data being processed right like, let me see the chat.
Let me see people. Well, you guys are
normal. Yeah, it gets all normalized, too much control. It gets normalized. Yes.
and and again, you know, I mean it. It gets convenient. Because, look, I, I want you to think about
for those of you who are like desperate. Oh, my gosh! This is too much control. This is awful.
There is always a flip side.
It makes your life very convenient, because you know, you know that Marcel had Covid. You know that you need to you. You watch yourself, you know. You know that you know, like the like in China during the Covid time, even to to this date people are able to know if they can go to the it's very easy for the government with this amount of data
to create a map.
a detailed map and tell the the population. Look those areas. Those are where we have Covid, so avoid, so it makes it makes easier for you. There is. There is a convenient kind of side.
You guys get what i'm trying to say. There is a cool so people it's almost like we are willing to give the data.
not everybody. But there's a lot of people saying, you know what I mean. It's actually for my safe it. Why not? Right? So
no North Korea, Kathleen. It's a little bit different. I would say that North Korea is still trapped in the in a very kind of
he hasn't changed much. I mean the type of control there he would be the we violent to us a societal sovereignty moving towards the disciplinary Society.
So it's kind of a mix of society, of sovereignty with disciplinary society. They are not here yet. Where China is.
you know.
Yeah. So this is very good. So people, so far, so good.
See how much time. You see.
I'm gonna take you now to Jeremy Bentham, because, look
I, we talked about Foucault already.
but I want to take you back to full call, because for quite a very important author.
and in the I mean
everything that the Lewis wrote about power and surveillance. I already told you. You got it from those slides here.
Okay, so you got it. I mean those lies. I mean, they're all here. That's it. He he never wrote too much about it. Unfortunately, I wish that this guy had to written more about surveillance.
Okay, so now we're gonna now that you understood what the Liz said about society of control. I'm going to take you to Foucault Marcel. Why, you're going to go back to focal in the kind of go deeper now, because he's a very important to offer for surveillance studies.
And some of you, if you ever decide to do a. You know, in both science or sociologic terminology. If you' to kind of study surveillance, you're going to need this guy. Okay. But before we talk about
so cool, I would like to talk about this other guy here called
Jeremy. He was a Scottish guy. Okay, British Scottish. And this guy here. He was traveling in Russia.
Okay, he was traveling Russia.
and he saw a building
that
someone introduced him to a building.
and and he had access to the blueprint of a building.
and he found this building. Extraordinary!
Why? Extraordinary? Because it was a kind of.
I think, that allowed for total surveillance, for, like complete surveillance.
so surveillance like it, you would. It. It was a kind of building that could serve. You know, the purpose of punishing people. It could be just guarding people watching people like you know, like you could work as it could work as a prison. It could work as a school where the teacher needs to see everybody equal to work as a workplace where you know, one big boss can see everybody working it could work it. It was like, in his opinion, his mind was a a fantastic.
multi-purpose building that would allow for any kind of life.
and like like any kind of any aspect of life you know Prisons hospital school, and in in he named
that that prison, that that building, Panopticon, or Inspection house.
he actually, when he was to traveling.
he wrote a letter, a bunch of letters about this building.
and and he sent those letters back to the Uk. And those letters became a book. They are compiled in the book today. That which is called Panoptican, or Inspection House. So a lot of the ideas behind surveillance, not only from the Liz, but also from Foucault.
He came from reading from them, reading that book. You know it's a collection of ladder. If you're curious, I mean, you can Google that you're gonna find the Pdf. If you want to see the actual booked. Our library, the of has it. Okay? So let me just see.
Yes, exactly, Selena, the panopticon. So look, this is the building, you know this is kind of an interpretation of the the this, this, this drawing was not by journey. This is an interpretation, but that would be the beauty. Imagine
this could work as a factory. It could work as a hospital; it could work as a school; it could work as a a prison. It could work as any kind of in any kind of situation where you need someone watching everybody. Right so.
and look, think of. Think about the economy of it. The economy of it. One person watching, let's say, 300 people.
So it's very economical.
Do you guys do do you see that? What i'm trying to say here, very economical. So surveillance has to do with the economy
because you save you save money, save, you know, like you save right. So by just having one person watching many.
So
this was actually the blueprint that you're gonna find. If you go fetch the book, the actual book that's that's what it looked like, okay and and okay. So so you so you know that that's all you need to know from Jeremy.
So he was the source of inspiration for full call for the news and for all the surveillance scholars. Okay.
So now, people we're gonna talk about. So let me just see if you have questions, or if there is anything that I that I need to address that I did not.
Yeah, actually. Yes, Elena, I later, when you were studying later, read this thing here. Okay, Read this part the slide. Okay, I'm not going to read for you just to save time. But read that. That's where you're going to find that his explanation
People, Are we good?
Can we continue
what a spot might be a bad thing for? Yeah. Would you mean a spotlight like when there is like a hidden kind of space. Yes.
but in this building joy there is no hidden. I mean, you can see everywhere like right like.
Oh, you mean like a spotlight like you. I didn't get your question, Joy. Explain to me what you mean. I did not get your question.
No, not the dates? No.
yeah, like joy. That that picture, this picture here is kind of
this is kind of a you know. Now that you're bringing this up. I'm not going to use that again ever in my course, because I mean, this is just like the actual pump optical that doesn't have that spotlight. Okay, I mean, this is just like a I our re interpretation. But the you know, actually, Joy, Thank you for bringing that up.
I'm not gonna ever use this picture again, because, look, the idea at the very idea of the panopticon is that you don't need a spotlight.
because I mean there's no need for that.
It's just like it. That's that's the beauty of this building. You don't need anything. I mean, it works again. Goes back to you guys later. You read, please. You read that, you know that's the you. You gotta read my slide. So you read this slide here because you're gonna it's beautiful, I mean, beautiful, like in terms of effective. It's extremely effective.
But thank you for bringing that up.
So let's see
if there is anything else. Make sense. Right? Okay, Good.
Okay, people. So let's talk about full call. Let me just pull my order. I have another ppt for you. Okay. So let me just stop sharing this one here.
I'm gonna get the order ppt that we have for today.
Okay. So
where is the meeting?
Oh.
you guys is up here? Okay, here.
Exactly, Lucy, Lucy. Wonderful comment. You're You're very right, you know. You're very right. So I love. I love that you guys brought this up. I mean, Thank you, Joy and all you cause that. Now it's actually making you think. Okay, yeah, yeah, that doesn't make sense. I'm gonna you know
that i'll never use that that I got that from the Internet. Just so you kind of, because sometimes it's hard to understand the blueprint.
But that fire back, you know. But that's weird in the hand was good.
So you see me right like you see, my
hey, people, let's go back. So look, i'm out like Foucault. Okay. So look.
people have just like like a phone call.
So now again, be aware, make make a note for you. You are going back to full call, and Foucault is.
we're talking about the disciplinary societies, our Society of Discipline. However, you want to call it like we're talking about discipline. Okay, we're not talking about the science of control that do lose. We're going to go back to into a little bit of a deep dive. Is that okay? Are you guys on the same spot with me. We are going back to full call just to do a big kind of a deep dive. Okay, just be be be careful here, so full call
for him to theorize power like I I I would like to tell you where his ideas came from
so focal. What he did was he was, he liked to do archive or search a lot. So he was. He always did a lot of archival research in Paris, in the museums in Paris. So he start to kind of compare this situation of a plague. Do you guys know what a plague is?
What is the plague people.
Blake, what is that word?
I want people plague like like Covid Covid became a plague.
Okay.
yes, it is some sort. Yes, exactly exactly. So it's some sort of like, you know, mass, sickness, illness. You know this disease that spreads.
And he compared the situation of okay. So let's talk about play first. So what do you do in a situation of playing? So
you know, according to his research archival research, what you do is you do strict spatial parting.
Okay, so it's like, you know. You kind of you you like when you go read like the the like, the chapter by full call. You're gonna see that in the beginning it scribes what we do.
So we we close everybody just like what we did with Covid. We close, we organize everybody we divide. People say, okay, you don't have Covid. You have let's organize society people who have Covid. You're going to say you're going to stay there. People who don't have. Covid, You're going to stay here. You're going to classify people. You're going to give them a green tag, I mean, if they are green they don't have, Covid. They're green. They have a green code just like they did in China. If you have Covid or red, that means that you have to quarantine you water. You sort.
you pro heaped you tell you, you people who have Covid. They cannot leave the house, you know, and you do. You do surveill you surveillance. They do surveillance surveillance on them. You
you make them stand still. It's about immobility just like we were. We were immobile like, right so and you punish people.
you know you punish the people who they don't comply. You punish them Obviously, in today's world you don't. We don't punish with death.
but you know, in it, like back in the days in the archives when you know, like you like Foucault Michelle for was doing research, you know, in France medieval times. If someone had like, you know, some sort of plague
like, you know, like you, you were like trans meeting that to someone. You could be killed right like for for doing that. So another thing that you do.
You do inspection
like like you, don't you never stop. Look at this word here. This is. See Sellessly, I mean you. You never cease to do inspections. So you are constantly monitoring watching. You know you. You create militia to help you watch
in China. I don't know if you guys heard that. But like people in China, they actually create some sort of it. It was kind of a a sort of militia neighborhood militia. So the the the people in that leash, and they would go around making sure that there was nobody in the streets, you know, you know, like that kind of stuff mean china. We had a little bit of that, too, because I mean you could get fined, you know, if you were out on the streets and get back. I remember people complaining a lot even here in that Newton, you know. And so you, you know you do create check
checkpoints in China.
in in Chinese seed is the way that people kind of the buildings. They are always in the kind of courtyard there is like a courtyard. There is a building, and there's another court er the building. What they did in China, for example, they get checkpoints for it to go in and out. You had to kind of show that you didn't have Covid. So you know. So it's all about visibility, you know, in full course, text. He's scribes that people, you know, like back in France they would be displayed like the government. Would, you know, Just ask people to just be displayed.
you know, in the window, so you know, like everybody would come to the you know the house window so the Government could see them and see if they didn't have symptoms. So you have to obey the authority, you know you have to. You know what it like, you know, like any kind of like disorder, any kind of extortion, any kind of theft, any kind of disorder would be punished.
Is this clear? So that's how we kind of you know
we deal with a situation of playing. I think that's kind of easy for you, because we just survived a plague right like. So we are kind of coming out of that. So it's sort of what happened to us.
And then.
So here's like, you know what i'm giving to you in those 2 lines is like it's. It's the idea, the big idea like the summary for you. Why do I have those drawings just to make you kind of like cute words
in a plague. What you do is you govern life and death. That's why I have a baby, and I have this this thing here symbolizing death. So enough situation of plague, according to full calls, like article in all chapter. You govern life and death.
So what he's trying to say he do Here, people he's trying to conceptualize. Take note of that. He's trying to with this idea of plague. Fu call is trying to conceptualize what
disciplinarian societies or disciplinary societies. Is that clear?
So he's trying to conceptualize Marcel. How about those other 2 drawings?
This is like a
cashier where you record? I put that in here just to kind of make you remember your word record because you record everything. You organize everything, everything you know. There, there are records being produced, and here, you know the same.
you know, like the the like. It's just kind of make you our just to make you remember like recording the idea of like records being produced. Think about the pandemic. If you're going to have a restaurant like the restaurant would want your, you know your I've like.
So I think. Let's see, because I can't even remember any more. I was like your name, and your contact information. Is that correct.
like even here in Canada, like I remember me going to, you know, Torinko, or you know, next to act. And people would ask, you know. Oh, yeah, your vaccine status wonderful? Yeah, You guys got it right? So so for you for us now, all kind of looks obvious. But again now, because we just survive the plague and what you know.
so that makes it's making more sense. So here those are the excerpts that you know that I want you to kind of pay attention to them. I mean when you are reading. But i'm not going to read them for you, because just for the sake of time.
So i'm August. So he
when i'm on. So when for call
talked about the plague, and that's you know the the bulk of the chapter is discussing how we manage a plague. What he, fu call, was trying to conceptualize what he called
disciplinary society. Okay.
you get it there.
Exactly.
Thank you. Grace.
So, people, if you're not following, just let me know, because I can repeat. And I want you to follow exactly that. Okay, so look. And why do those features that I have here is just like a little summary for you the idea that power this is like a power kind of thing. As I put here. So you remember, power power is almost like it's continuous.
right? So it's like, you know. It's it's it's a it's. Look! And you're gonna tell them bomber cell this does not match with what you just said
like
right. I mean if you have a good memory, and if you work, pay attention to what I just said when I was talking about this, and I was talking about how to lose, interpreted Foucault. You're gonna No, no, but for the lose like Power became continuous Later in his society in the Society of of control.
not in this disciplinary society.
Am I right? Did you guys understand what i'm saying?
Did you guys get that contradiction.
I want people. I need you to to be on board with this. What I'm trying to say to you here is okay. You You got it. Okay? Why? Because again, that text was the this interpretation of full call.
Now you're actually listening to full call and for call. He he talks about like, you know.
power being continuous, but he did not kind of delve too much on that. But even like he was sale, Power is like more continuous, you know. But but you know he was also saying that to us continual. So you know, Co. Wrote a lot.
and it's like in even like this chapter is a long chapter. So sometimes he, you know, he's not like super super accurate. Okay. So just be mindful of that.
Okay. So. But don't you worry because in the exam i'm not going to create traps around that. No, because that would be too crazy like 2.
But so, anyway. So look so. Here's full call, like another part, just full call. Kind of trying to explain. You know. The power, you know, becomes continuous, you know. Sometimes he goes back to the idea of enclosure again, you know. So it's not very, very super clear. He's trying to create
a type of power he's trying to, you know, create the topology for power. So
another here for you.
So this is just to summarize those 2 slides here in key phrases for you. So remember, you know, disciplinarians in a disciplinary society like Bifurc.
Remember management of my from death.
Remember data collection.
you know, like here, like like like information being recorded right so in. If you read, you're gonna see that in a situation of plague like according to full call in the chapter he talks about like, you know, people's demographic being collected, you know all sorts of information being collected right so, and then a situation of confinement, you know.
That was according to focal. But look, this is me telling you today. We don't really need confinement anymore. I mean, we had confinement in the Covid.
but it's almost like it. We are able to control without co confinement. Okay, but again, but you could say otherwise. You would say, No, no. We still need confinement, because people don't obey right, and not everybody will base the the orders, but anyways power continuous, you know, according to full call.
If that'sparity in mind, I mean, keep like that, you know, for the his interpretation of for a little bit you from the natural focal.
and the environment becomes a disciplinary mechanism. So that's the idea. The whole environment
is built in a way that it forces you like a pre a playground like, you know. The camera like it forces you. Okay.
So so that's why he calls like it. Doesn't it doesn't really queue anybody, but it disciplines you so if you don't have your Covid pass, you cannot enter. If you don't have. If you don't want to give your Covid information.
you're not gonna be able to sit and eat at the ringco in Edmonton, right? So it it is an environment that forces you in the end. You might even say i'm not gonna take the vaccine. I'm against the vaccine, or I'm afraid the vaccine or whatever. But in the end you even comply because
it's like that environment. If you don't have the vaccine, it makes your life miserable. You guys get what i'm saying. Probably you heard, I mean I heard friends say, oh, you know I don't agree with that vaccine, and I don't like the vaccine, or i'm afraid of the vaccine, but i'm in the end all of them. They took it because
it was almost like unbearable, because if you don't have the vaccine. You can't try, and we can't. You can't, can't, you know You cannot do anything right? So
No, Joey, the environment is but for everyone, and that's Why, people, even people who didn't take the vaccine in the end in my example. Here they ended up taking it, because it makes your life a nightmare. If you don't have it
So that's the idea. The idea! Jo is the opposite of what you you know. So I mean I I just want to make sure that you understand that I mean it is an environment that you forces you to apply. And even if you kind of you know, you want to not comply.
You comply in the end, I mean, of course, we still have lots of people that say, oh, i'm not gonna just to use the Covid Fax, in example, a lot of people, said I'm not gonna take it. And I actually know a few people who never took it
but but their lives, I mean.
Oh, gosh, it's just like
It's just almost like unbearable, because you know, and not to mention the social criticism that they get right. So it's like it's just like it becomes unbearable.
Okay, so far, so good people.
So look
what is the what is like now that we like kind of understood what he's saying, what would be the strategy to combat the plague.
So 2 things, and he says that in the text number one order
order to fight confusion and fear.
So those are the things that you do.
You create some sort of all, all the present and ominous and ordering like this kind of power that is everywhere that can see everybody that is continuous.
Oh, we're so like, but like continues like Julie again, what that was the loose interpreting Here's who quote telling you
so. It lays out people's place. It tells you where you should go, and where you cannot go, where you know it tells you almost like who you are.
outlines your body, I mean Marcella outlines body. Yes.
because top of your body goes to your body, tells you. You know it. It goes. Really. I don't know if you guys feel that with Covid. But it was really about the body. It's almost like you cannot sneeze anymore. You can't coffee anymore. Now, I after Covid I became afraid of people cough and sneeze, and it's like, you know, I became this paranoid person, and even me and I can on the airplane when i'm coffee and sneezing. I'm ashamed. I don't know if you guys feel the same way, but it like it controls my body almost, you know, like it's almost like in voluntary.
you know, like I like kind of a sneeze, and I go. Oh, my! I'm so sorry like you know. I mean, why do you have to you? You're a human or sneezing, you know, like, but it changes you and outlines your body, and and and even like outline, in a way that if i'm sneezing, I put my you know I do that, and then like it, it is outlining by by, you know
it gives visibility to death in life. It becomes life. It makes, you know. You know, people who are dying You you're we are counting like you think about all the Government information that it was being F that you was about like. You know how many people are dying every day, and and how many people are becoming cured every day. So it's like, you know, information about life and death, and that's why you know, we talked earlier that you know, in a disciplinary society there is this management of life right? Like you don't kill people. You just manage their life
from Guinea toand
It defines what is true and what was. It is not true, you know. Think about the core of it, I mean.
you know, like people find No, this is true. This is not true in the government. Say, this is true. You know
it creates multiple separators or separations for people. So you know we become kind of every everything's organized.
and it designs individualizing distributions like.
you know. It's almost like, you know. I distribute to. I i'm gonna distribute you guys. I'm gonna sort, you guys, you know, individualizing away. I'm gonna say, okay, you are sneezing. You go there, your coffee. You go here, you have fever. You go there you have nothing. You go over over there. You you know you in a very individualizing way.
Okay, so let's see. I still have a couple of minutes. I'm going to use it. So look now, I'm gonna tell you guys something else.
So he
imagine for call sitting in the archives, analyzing how we manage plague in the seventeenth, eighteenth century, and he writing, trying to kind of make sense of surveillance of power. Right so.
And then he starts to compare. He starts to compare the idea of plague and leper. What is leper People
people leper quick here in the chat. Do you know what i'm talking about? Leper.
Is it? Is that illness as well? Yeah, leprosy, Exactly. It's leprosy. Okay, Exactly.
Now let me take you. I'm gonna take you. I know that we're probably I mean, you know, i'm sure that even if you are not from your religion background, your family, religious background is not Christianity.
I'm sure that you do have some knowledge of the Bible, because I mean it's it's it's bigger than us right. It it is a society so in think about the Bible or the the knowledge that you have it can be a lot of knowledge or limited knowledge.
What do people do with those who had lepers back in the days in the Bible
people back. We don't have a lot of time come to the chat.
Think about your knowledge vanished. What else?
Exile? What else? People. You're right. That's exactly that you exclude. You banish because I don't touch them. You stay away from them right? So, for call you start to think about compared comparing the idea of a plague and the idea of a le of leper.
because, like what we do is
with people who have leprosy, we like, not any more. But I mean, this is he's like building on historical facts, so he can do theory about power and surveillance. So he was like, okay.
you know it's different. I mean the plague. You don't exclude anybody.
You don't put, put people away. What you do is you sort. You You divide, you classify, you organize, you manage.
but with leprosy you don't do none of that. You just exclude.
so like you know, like you, you, you know you send people to some valley I mean talking about the Bible. You know. You send people to the valley some sort of valley, and then they all live there, and everybody has, and they die together. They live together, I mean nobody cares about them. Everybody stays away from them, and they have no contact with society. There's no management. There is just simply exclusion.
So look so, Foucault. It starts to kind of make a comparison. Here, Leper, exclusion, rejection, separation, exclusion, from power dynamics.
You take that person completely away from power dynamics, and they develop communities
ironically. Right? So that's the irony of it. I mean, you exclude. And then they create communities, and we've played. What you do is you subdivide. You distribute them, you know, like
you, you you you know you. You organize them in a way that you know even create identity, allows for them to develop into new forms of identity. You, I then look instead of exclusion them from power dynamics, You
you intensify
power dynamics. You intensify power over them. So if you go read the chapter, you're gonna see that when you know full code scribes that, but it the plague. And if you got my lecture it's much more control.
You know it's what which more power over those people.
But you know with later. You know. You just send them away.
you know. So here they develop communities, and here in the plague they develop a disciplinary society.
So if I did a good job. I'm not sure if I did.
You are able now to kind of see
the formation of that disciplinary society
kind of building on the idea of like so Foucault used. Take note of that. Foucault used
some sort of plague in society
to develop the concept of disciplinary society.
Is this clear people?
Let me see if this because this is this, is going to be on the exam. You need to know that the concept of Disciplinary Society came from, where Leper? No leprosy, no plague.
hey? Good.
So later You're going to read the stuff that I've left for you. Here, let me just see how much time I have with 2 min I don't have more time. So just wrap up here. Look actually for those important science. Come on, people in both science people call science. We are talking about 2 types of governance. The leper is a type of governance that could
cut cut off.
You know people from it, cut it cuts people off from all sorts of human contacts human contact.
It is a project. It is a governess
that has a project of exclusion. So, Lot Leper.
What kind of governance is this exclusion?
And how about Blake? What kind of governess is this? It is a governance of life and death
that you you control every aspect of society. It is the the type of governance that we kind of have today, even though we are moving to the science of control.
Keep it even the size of control. Who is to govern life? Right? So
so look it's not. It looks like a perfectly governed kind of city. That's what he says. This is his words. Actually okay, so
are those 2 types of governance compatible? Yes, they are
now, and Sometimes they come together. We're gonna talk about that, you know, because in today's society quite often, we use surveillance to exclude people.
So those 2 types of society. They come together. Okay, so, people, we didn't have time to talk about privacy. But it's okay. We're gonna do it next next week next to Thursday. So let me just see here, so that's it for today.
So let me know. I mean, you know, if you have any question, anything, you stay on the chat, please. I have off hours, too, and i'd like to issue a thing i'd like to thank you for your attention. I hope that all of them made sense to you. If not, please stay in the chat
and and thank you very, very much for attending class. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate your comments on the chat. Really, really, you know, Thank you very much.
You guys take care of
stay safe people, exercise. Take care of your mental health and physical health.
Any question. Just stay on the chat.
If you're waiting for off hours. I'm gonna as soon as everybody's going, i'm gonna open off hours. Thank you very much. People think all of you. I see your names here. Thank you very much.
You guys take care.
Hey, Nicole.
are you there?
Oh, sorry, no, I'm.
I oh, i'm good. I'm.
There you you
Thank you. You take care.
Hey, Valencia, Are you gonna move to office hours? I'm gonna open up right now for you. If you want you want to move there.
Sure.
well answer. Did that make sense to you? Let me just stop a recording hold on a second. I'm just.
"

















Jan 26

"Hey, folks! Welcome aboard! Welcome back! Hello, everybody!
I'm sorry I'm a little bit like slightly late late. I mean comparison to every day.
It's not even a minute. But like I had some issues with my zoom here. I don't know I had to restart my computer.
So how is everybody today.
We don't have a lot of people today, I think
just 21 people.
Okay, okay, everybody's doing well.
Okay. So first a heads up for you. If you go to E class.
you're gonna see there that like last week
after class I up or earlier this week after class, I updated one slide. So if you see this slide for last class, if you go on the class, I I am just checking or not to make sure that it is. Yeah. So if you go under theorizing surveillance one.
and if you see, like last lecture
you, you're gonna see that there is no less no sorry. The the lecture for the
for the nineteenth.
You're gonna see that there is a slide that has been revised. Okay, Slide Number 7. I'm: Just
yeah, that's it. So I just took like, you know, like there was like somewhere there. It was written disciplinary societies, institutions.
and then just cross that. You're gonna see Red, because I I kind of I kept I
changes so you could see, you know, just like just to make sure that you know. So whenever there is a need for me to
revised the slide to. Sometimes it's something wrong or something that's missing, or whatever i'll let you know, just like I did this time like you're gonna see on the class, you know, like oh, you know, revise that like, you know, check slide, whatever. Okay? And then you're gonna You're gonna open up and you're gonna see it. So if you have any concern
just going there and check it as i'm starting. And then you can ask your question. Okay. But do you have any questions so far? Are you guys doing well? I mean, are you? Is it making sense? I mean, are you learning something, because that's my concern. If you're learning something.
Come on, folks. Where are you guys? So are you checking these slides or your
okay? You're learning okay, good. Someone is learning. Okay, okay, good. So people you need to tell me, because again, the purpose is I what you guys should learn. But more than just learn. I want you guys to get your own brains kind of going.
so you know you can kind of start to think about surveillance for yourself and by yourself. I would like my dream here if I do a job, because, like this topic is going to stick to your mind forever, I mean, which is a little bit depressing. But you're going to learn a lot. Okay, and you're going to start kind of
Oh, look at this. She never said this. But now you're gonna create your own knowledge. Okay. So okay. So yeah, Joey, that's the purpose. I mean, it's a class of supposedly. If I do a job. You should be talking about it outside. Okay, so let me. Just. We're going to just finish off what I mean. We just have a couple of lines from my squad to finish.
I am going to share with you right now. I'm sharing.
Let me just make this bigger.
Oh.
it's coming. I think I would just duplicate this.
Okay. So now you should be able to see me and this lines. So if you, if that's not the case, please let me know. Okay. So let's just go to the end all the way to the end. So look, we talked a lot last class about
the plague which Michelle Fu call the French philosopher use to theorize disciplinary societies or societies of discipline or disciplinary society. However, you want to phrase it in English, he phrased. I mean the translation is disciplinary societies.
But again, this is like it comes from French. So you know there's some space for you know, accommodation here. So
so we talked a lot about, you know the like, the the the difference between the plague and and leprosy.
And we and I finish off last class, saying that essentially what we have here like after analyzed archival materials is that we have 2 types of governance, and I remember me rushing
to try to get those slides here for you, but like but that was the point. So leper is a type of governance. I mean in this text that that signifies a project of exclusion. You exclude people. You don't care about them. You are Ill out.
It's almost like you put a cross. You cancel them out.
Okay, so it's actually worse than cancelling, because it's almost like it's You're out of society
and Blake is the opposite. You don't exclude anybody. Everybody is in it is a social project which is, by the way, is very democratic.
Where the people with both science, it's very democratic. Okay. So like the the the leper project is not because it's you. You exclude people, but the plague from the Political science. Perspective is a democracy because
there is a space for everyone. It is just like in brave New World. There is a space for everybody, but some people will be Alpha. Some people will be better. Some people will be epsilon. So you know so
and so it's like like essentially what Foucault says is like like the plague.
It. It it looks like it looks like a society that is perfectly governed.
Okay, so everything is accounted for. Let me just take a look at the chat to see what what's going on here.
Yeah, Well, that I love this Jessica Jessica put it very nice people, I mean, yeah, it's it's not cancelling. It's Billy Team
and and that delete that is forever. I mean, you know you take it from your trash, can, too. I mean it's out right. So I I like this analogy. It's nice one.
Thank you.
Okay. So here I that's pretty much actually where I where I stopped. And this is my question for you.
Can those 2 types of societies or governance be reconciled? Are they compatible?
And the answer is, Yes, they are.
Think about surveillance people
and think about monitoring, pick up, think about data, collection everything that surveillance in there.
It can be extremely unfair.
He can. If there is a point to scheme, Caller. I am a I live witness of that because every time that I go through you know the airport, you know, I get pulled out, and I have to, you know, like, and then I see people that are not, and it's so funny because I have to share this with you.
I told you guys, that I spent last year in France right like I told you that. So let me share with you my first actually like this the first image that I had of Paris. So I flew in.
and then I I passed through integration.
But when I was queuing up in immigration, the first thing that I noticed was
and i'm not kidding was that, like like the darker you were in color.
the more kind of not abuse. I don't want to say a views, but, like the more rude the officer. The immigration officer would be with you.
So I was there waiting and watching, obviously coming from surveillance. I watched those things, and I could see like I saw. I remember seeing a woman and kids, and she was a a black, very dark skin.
and and like in it immediately. I could even hear, like the tone of what I mean. I was a little bit far away in the queue, but I could hear, you know, like imagine, I mean, I could hear the officer
talking to her, and kind of, you know, very kind of suspicious like it, like you have something to hide. Who are those children? What? What do you? What? What you're gonna do here in France, and and what's so funny because after
anyways, we kind of went, I mean, she went through, and then I came right after I went through, and then we went to there is like after right after you, you. You passed through the integration you have to collect your baggage, and then you put your baggage, your luggage through an X-ray
and and and then I love watching those things like whenever there is an X-ray, and people are kind of being selected. I was like, okay, let me watch this.
And indeed, the the same woman that was kind of being kind of not treaty, being not being treated with the same politeness that I I was, for example, some other people, or she would. She had to go through the the X-ray, and I did not.
You know, and when many, all the the people that I saw you know like nobody else went through. She was the only one pulled aside. So
anyways, I mean. So i'm just saying this because if you start to actually pay attention.
you're gonna see that surveillance can get very unfair, and we talked about that before in the course, and there is also a flip side, because your events also can produce fairness so like you. One of our articles, the readings that we had. It talks about what I mean in the past. Not today's class, but in the past. It talks about like a
how a woman talks about credits for like just a quick example, the text it talks about like how you know, like, because there's no algorithms and surveillance like doing people's credit scores like, you know, like black folks in the United States.
They, I mean they are not there. There is, there is no longer as much prejudice and discrimination against them as he used to be when there was a clerk, you know, like you know, an employee, a bank employee doing those credit scores, so you can go both ways. But we do see that surveillance is getting very unfair, you know. So surveillance has with the body, you know, so like the type of body that you have. It could be like, you know. I'll give you another example. Women who are pregnant
like until very recent like. If you were a pregnant women you would be seen by airport security almost as like. Oh, you know you're not a threat.
but then like in precisely because that was in case smugglers and and and you know, and like people dealing with drugs, they start to kind of pick up like meals, like transporters for pregnant women. The same is true for older folks like you older people.
They were never seen as a fat until now they became like, you know, one new, like the people who to support the drug. And now you know so so the has to be. If your body has to your social income, your income, your social class. Right so.
But anyway, so the point here is that I mean those 2 projects. They're being there, you know. They are kind of coming together. So it's possible that we have. You know, those 2 types of situations Our governance in one single society. Is this clear? So far, people?
I want to see some. Yes, and that's just my strategy to make sure you guys are alive, and you're not like
dying behind the screen, tired and annoyed, or something. Okay, people stay staying there. Go get some coffee or something.
So Val answer here. Would Would it be safer to say that it would be like it will send you. Yeah, kind of yeah, it would be, you know, but not not even like a: yeah, it would be more. Yeah, yeah, it is safer to say that in place like more, if you want to make it this kind of typology that's possible, but even people it's just because you guys did not read the whole book
in both societies in both societies Brave New World in and 1984. You do have a a a sub society.
or like a a place
that territory that is kind of you know, where you dump
like the people. Okay, dump. We've both okay. So you dumped people in there to people that you were excluding. So
i'm. See here some more. Matthew: this is right. Okay.
artificial intelligence software called Amazon. Okay, we recognition with Police Department United States.
This is Pax on the side?
Exactly.
Yes, I'm just going to finish reading into here.
Yes, exactly. You're very right. Okay, you. So you see, bias
being carried inside of the the algorithm in a very structural way, right like.
So let's see Joy here.
Yes, beautiful work.
So, Joy, you still. Yeah, you guys are doing, you guys rock and roll. Look, yes, and joy. Here comes with another an additional comment.
adding to Maths example: Yes, you're right. So surveillance can exclude and include at the same time
and survey. Yeah, this is beautiful. That's it. I mean, perhaps you could even finish the course. You know you got it. Okay.
So very good. So people look at this. This is what full process. Okay, so that you know that the cause Again Foucault went, and he read the Panopticon right by Betham or the Inspection House, because it has 2 names.
And he said that you know the panopticon is the architectural figure of the plague and the leper combined.
Okay. And here, let's just have a look look at this I would like to kind of go over those points where they're important. So the watcher in the Panopticon, the person who is doing the surveillance enjoys
full visibility.
so you it's almost like
the visibility, like you know, the the the space show, like the the geography of it.
is reorganized to facilitate visibility. So when we think about that, our that our architecture, I mean the whole geography is meant to facilitate visibility.
and and that is the case when we think about the CD. I haven't really walked around, and anything yet since I arrived from Brazil. But I can give you some examples from Brazil.
Brazil's a very violent country. So we do have, like a lot of the cities, the mayors. They create those architectures that they are very spooky like, and then people don't really have way to kind of shelter in there, or staying there, which is by way legal, resume it.
Mayors these 2 do that so they all. They put some like, you know, like things that are spooky, and and then, you know, nobody can, or so usually they do that under bridges. They do that under, you know, under some sort of space where people would be able to shelter.
And and one of the things that they argue is that I mean, though, that kind of architecture.
It generates visibility because it expels the people out so it makes them visible. It's almost like they. You know they they that that kind of architecture exposes the person that's that's what it is, and that's what they come optical that that does. I'm sure that in that meant that we do have, just because I'm i'm not fresh with the city because I I was a year old. But perhaps you guys can think of something
that you know there's some sort of architecture that is, it's made in order to kind of give the core visibility the the you know. I mean, i'm going to use. I'm gonna sociology here and use the deviant categories, the poor.
the the drug addict, you know, like the those who are excluded right like. It gives them visibility, and it exposes them.
So i'll. I'll check the check because perhaps you guys came up with something. But look! Surveillance subjects are individualized into an optic. I get Ming sales, and I can see each and every one of those. So it's very individualizing right like.
And
he says that the surveillance that the with an opticon a reverses the principle of the dungeon, which is like the cave, the the dark right. So, by doing what like usually like caves. They are enclosed. They are deprived of light, and they are at least to hide the panoptical.
It undoes that. So it actually you know, the only thing that is space in terms of like. If you want to compare it up an optic, and the engine is the enclosure, Everything else it's about light. It's about visibility. So surveillance people. When you think surveillance, you have to think about this, they call me
dark and light, hide and expose visibility.
and you know you have to think about that, because that's what surveillance does. Surveillance can be used to. You have to hide something
it can be used to, you know, to show something, but ultimately
like what? What makes it so powerful like that? It is it's ability to sh to cast light. Okay, I'll. I'll check the check in a second. So
So look at this. I really like this part. Actually the full lighting lightning in the eye of the supervisor capture better than darkness, which is outwardly protected.
So visibility becomes a track independent, and in surveillance is like that. So you have to be very careful with what you'd scroll and what you don't dispose right. Let me just see the check before we go.
We have plenty of anti- homeless. Exactly.
Yeah.
exactly. So it's definitely so
if you can think of anything specific and great, I mean, because yeah, there are many just to just to share, I actually I've seen those spooky things in a meeting that you know, like in downtown
Jessica Park benches. Oh, yeah, this is a very good one. Yeah department. Yes, and it's often now that they are even taking out the benches, because I remember me again. I remember me like in several like in in in in France. People like
most of the I've been to a couple of several train stations in France.
and it's extremely annoying, because there is very, very limited space to sit. I remember one specific train station that was on 1 one of the places that I lived.
I I I was always very annoying. I know I did there, because I mean there was no no place to pay like, no no place to sit. So you would see that fast area. You could buy some costs, you know, you could buy some coffee, but like, you know, there's no place to say it. So continues Remove yeah, yeah, the the camps. Yeah.
but it's like it, but that that agree, or it's nice. It's a nice example, but it's more like an action.
This bench that the Park Bank is a very nice architecture. It it showcase the architecture.
I get help like that. I can't. I just see this question here because everyone's visible. But
how is it ever the like. We know there is no visibility. You have you? You kick people out, you, and therefore they become they become hidden. I mean they. You hide them away. So the panopticon is. Is the is this the the the the the this idea that
you know it's a it's a kind of I mean
again.
It's a kind of I mean it. It's almost like you don't do surveillance in there you you like in this model. I mean, that focus is talking about. There is no surveillance in there, you know, but, like what he did was he used this to think about. Okay, this excludes that does not include that that does not include it. And then he use those 2 ideas
to think about surveillance. Doesn't mean that you know. You know enough. If we go back to the Bible example in our valley, where there's a lot of you know, like a leprosy I mean doesn't mean that there's surveillance there. No, that's not what full call was doing. It was just kind of getting those examples to get inspired. I can go back to that later. Valencia. Okay.
Is it ironic? Let me see here.
Yeah, it it is ironic, you know
it is.
Oh, Uk: Matthew, it's just the I mean, Uk is
the birth of surveillance studies and also surveillance. Okay, so like of all the in in the West, I would say that well United States kind of catched up. But like the Uk is just like huge. It was one of the first countries to kind of deploy cameras, and I think I believe that it is to the the country, the the area of the world, I mean. You know, the countries that we know group of countries that has the most amount of of a certainless cameras.
So China Doesn't I mean China is is top top top of the world in terms of surveillance. But i'm talking about the Western world right like.
Yes, Exactly. So I appreciate your example, your comment. Thank you. Okay, people. So look
here.
Are you all good, Valencia and everybody else. Can I move ahead.
Yeah, no.
I can come back to stuff later, because I always okay. Good.
Okay. So people look power. The principles on power, according to Ben Benton's and Foucault.
So power is visible.
Okay.
So so like
it, it's again. You You are always in there, you know, like you. You are always under visibility.
and it is very few verifiable. So you'd never know if you are actually gonna watch it. You don't know again. It's just like I told you guys I don't know, like in my credit card, like I get the impression. I am under the impression that my credit card right now is not under surveillance.
because there's nobody here in my room but but but it is because there is a system out there that is, is kind of as as as soon as I stemmed up in here, leave the house and swap my card. They will catch me, so i'm i'm being monitored, even though there is no cameras in here. There's nobody, even though the card is in my pocket. So there is a system that monitors and it sees. Okay, Marcellus card is stand still
nothing is happening, but that in itself is a piece of information. Okay, so so power is unverifiable. So the symbol in fucose writing is this Venetian blind that you kind of. You know why? Because you don't you you cannot just no way that you know there is. There is visibility coming you coming through and or not. It depends how you adjust.
and and people will know if you are seeing them or not. Okay. So just kind of
metaphor or also zigzag opening, you know, Sometimes.
like, instead of having a door, they go through. You have to go like you go inside, go on your left on your right, and then you, you know you go into the room that's called zigzag openings, you know. So that is just an example of like, you know something that you don't really know what's happening. Right? So
so essentially, I mean this. This part here is interesting for you guys to read later, you know.
But like, you know, but but the the what's the in it's like. Let's read the An optical is a machine for this, the associating
the C. And P. C.
Did so. You don't know I mean it. It's kind of you, don't know, because, like you know, without surveillance. You know that I mean that you know that I i'm watching you. But in a panoptic, and people don't really see, you know, like they don't know that when the guards is actually looking when the guards not looking so, and also something that I didn't say that tower.
you know.
like they're they're They're like 360 degrees windows, and then they use like, you know, the divination blinds. So that's you know that's kind of so that's why people don't really know if where the guard is looking right. So
so he sees everything you you know we thought we'd seen, so that's why you know visibility. This like to see is about visibility. So that's why you know for it to think surveillance. You need to think about this like Anthony, you can see, or you don't see on and off right like
people
here.
What is powered in? Is it a person because we
we tend to think of power as a person, as someone doing something to us.
But no.
So you know. Is it an authority, a figure of authority according to full call? No
power according to full call is this environment
where this environment, where you know
you, you are always being controlled. So it's not like, and that's that's major for you people in both science. I'd like you to remember that whatever.
like the most contribution that Full has to Paul, science is that it, like he came up with like a a definition of power or conceptualization of our
that takes power away from that idea. That power means government. That power means, you know, usually government, like you know, or a person a person in a position of power? No, for full call. Power does not lie with me, you know, like the teacher doesn't have power
like, and also. I didn't put that on this slide. But for full call, power is not is not something that you can grab on on that that you can. You can hold, you know, like this spray here. You know
the power is not that you cannot. It's it's not a thing that you can like. Grab like that power happens in the relationship.
So power is this relationship that we have with the environment which includes everything, from humans to cameras, to everything, to we rules organizations, institutions.
Is this clear people?
I really need you to remember that. Okay. So his contribution is this: like breaking the idea that power is government, and I know that for Paul Science that is kind of oh, my gosh! That's not what I've seen so far, because
I don't know how poly science goes here in Canada, but you usually talks about like you study a lot like you know, like hop hopes or hopes. Hope is, you know, like the hope is in state. Lock, Russo, and then you learn that you know power is the state and the and then, like all of a sudden, No, it's
No. And that's why people call for coast power micro power. Okay, micro power.
Okay.
So
So anyways, and also power according to full call, is very, very economical. There is no waste.
There's no waste.
and it's actually very profitable, very like, you know. It's very useful, very economical. I mean that the word is actually economical, because just like I told you, it's like one person
gonna watch many people.
So it's like, you know. You don't have to pay like, you know, and that has to do with the geography. Because if you alter that geography of that panopticon, then you're gonna have to pay more guards to watch. Let's suppose it's a reason you're gonna have to pay more of security guards or correctional officers to take care of it
right like, but because it is but the way that it is
it is. There is no waste. There is no waste of waste of resources. Okay.
it it's very precise. Okay.
So far so good.
We're gonna. I'm gonna finish this slide and move to the next one. Okay.
Okay. So we see more people here. This this is good. I'm happy to see all of you guys so far. So it's clear people.
Hey? I am gonna go share my slide with you here. Okay. So now.
So look, I try to. What we did was we started the course with
just
we talked about literature, you know, and then we went from literature. We we talked about for call. We talked about Delus. And and
so now we're gonna actually, you know. Now, you kind of have the foundation. Now you are able to kind of see. You should be able to see different types of power, different types of governance, like different types of surveillance, and all those words they boil down to sort of the same thing. We're talking about monitoring control.
Okay.
So let's talk about privacy now.
So look switching gears Here, privacy.
I don't have my watch, my my phone here, people. How much time do I have? Just so I can time up myself. Can someone down on the chat?
Okay, so wonderful. Okay, let's go. Let's get going. I want to finish this. I want to do this whole class today. So look.
we're going to talk about privacy, and we're going to discuss the article by this guy called Daniel. Okay, it's called privacy
an umbrella, an umbrella term for a plurality of things. So essentially like. Let's kind of you know the purpose of this. This. This first article is just to kind of get you thinking about privacy.
and then in the next art what? We're gonna actually talk about some legislation. Okay. But i'd like to take kind of make you think about it what that is. And then, you know, okay, if people wake up, get some coffee, what is privacy?
What is that? Don't Don't look this like? Just tell me on the chat. I mean, what's privacy for you? I mean for you don't do sociology, you know, like just just or or what part of science or technology just like. Tell me what is privacy for you? As if your own words and you know.
Okay. So
like everything that is for me to see to know. Okay, so this is private, not being monitored. Yeah. Well, the this is a good one. Yeah, all of them the fastest in my life and stuff that, you know that is not controlled, that I would be on
uncomfortable. Okay stuff that you wouldn't share, you know, and comfortable sharing. You know stuff that
how feasible. You are okay, okay, Good. So let's see what else the ability to keep your personal information away from the public eye environment.
an environment where you perceive to have a decent level of isolation. Okay, so you're saying, privacy is kind of some sort of isolation having agency over your own visibility. Okay, so Look
you you guys are, you know. Yeah, you're You're there. We're gonna come to a definition here. So look at this.
The first thing I like to to keep free. To keep in mind
is the interaction between surveillance and privacy. Okay, before we even think about privacy, let's just think about like how those 2 things interact surveillance people implies agents like implies an agent
who, you know, look into your personal data. So surveillance means data collection. It means monitoring. So that means that someone, some sort of system, some sort of agent, will look into personal data. Okay, that's kind of surveillance
and privacy is about restricting access to personal data. So that's what actually, privacy is. So privacy is
to restrict access.
But the problem is, you're gonna have bomber cell. This is so broad. So privacy. Actually it it has to do with isolation. The person who said isolation it has to do with isolation.
but not in not the sense of like you being away from society? No, it is in the sense of like your data being isolated from those who should not, you know, look into it, or you know, or you being able to kind of protect your data. In that sense. He has isolation.
you know. But to some extent all of what all, all of you. You said something that kind of goes. It boils down to this idea of, like you being able, you know, to restrict
access to your own data, right? So it doesn't make sense to you guys, I mean. So remember those 2 things.
There is an interplay here. So surveillance means someone looking into your data, and privacy means you limiting, restricting. You know, someone's ability to look into your data. Okay, let me see the chat, because now
it's getting
not be monitored. Yeah. So it's not real, Jacob. Really. Good. Yeah. So that would go back to that broad question. Yes, so. But you see now that we are kind of thinking together here, and we are getting more scientific.
It is so privacy, I mean. Again, of course, I ask what you guys I mean I I appreciate. Thank you for your answers, I mean, I asked, like from your mind and what you think. But now that now I invite you to kind of come to the text.
and in the taxes like it's about. You know privacy about restricting information. So look, privacy does not mean it does not mean not be monitored.
It means limiting. You know, that monitoring. You know the the access to that data that's been collected, or to them monitoring to the act of being monitored.
Is, does it make sense?
So let's just see what I need something here not being monitored, or at least I okay, yeah. So privacy is the right
to refuse.
Not necessarily. Not yet. I mean, I didn't talk about any right yet. I mean, it is like this idea that you can restrict. So it would be the right to restrict.
Yeah, you could say right to refuse. You could say, refuse not. This is not going to be used. Okay, you could put that that way, but it don't don't put it in terms of rights yet. I don't want you guys thinking about like human rights or as a right. I want you to think about the action. Just think about the action.
Okay, like. So that's what privacy is. So it boils down to that action. Okay.
let's see what else you here.
So look.
what do they have in common service and privacy?
So it's about information control. So both of them surveillance and privacy. Both both things are about information control. Because again, if if I am doing surveillance on you.
I am controlling the information, and and and if you know, and if you are kind of, you know, like trying to protect your privacy, you are trying to protect the information that can be shared, and the information that cannot be shared right so, and surveillance can invade privacy. You can.
It does that right? So quite often. It does that.
However, privacy
also can protect surveillance.
You guys get what i'm saying you can. You know you can use surveillance to invade privacy, and you can use privacy, loss to protect surveillance. So you know, this surveillance is gonna happen, because here, you know, we need some privacy. So therefore, you know, we need to collect data.
So it it goes both ways. Surveillance can.
Yeah. So it can for a survey and and and surveillance can protect privacy. So
it's about information control. It is about surveillance. He can invade private privacy. Privacy can protect surveillance, and and also vice versa.
Okay, so keep those things in mind. I want you to kind of keep this because
the way that we are taught in society is that almost like that privacy is this value?
It's a bad way in itself.
We are not thought
to think about privacy as an action.
And now I mean you guys are here, and this is university. This is supposed to be science. So like it's no longer about like moral values and and judgments. Of course, I mean in the end we go to there because I mean, you know. But first you need to understand it, like, you know, in the more kind of cold way.
you know, and be very aware that I mean, because we tend to think of privacy. Something that is so is good.
Not necessarily, not necessarily, you know.
Sometimes the privacy of their home, the privacy of the home, the privacy of the family can hide, for example.
child abuse.
So you know. So you have to kind of. So as a researcher. You need to be always aware that it can go both ways. You
let me just see
the chat. It is a double. He is like, yeah, double edge sport, or even a catch kind of 22, right, as you guys say in English. So
so but keep this in mind. So. Look. This is like the guy that that wrote the text that we are writing today, Daniel. And here's the book. So you just can see, because I I like to kind of give you guys the the text and the book, because then it kind of give sense. You know what you're reading and what's coming from.
where it's coming from. Look.
Let me give you now the main idea from this text, the main idea, the new idea here is very, very easy.
However.
it's so easy that you make make you guys kind of second get yourself, or even confused.
The idea here is that privacy is a social concept. Okay, right now.
privacy is a social concept. Okay, myself. But that means what
that means a lot. Because when you say that something is social.
that's something that means that it means that something changes over time. It varies according to culture, if there is according to time and space.
So when I say privacy is social.
we can. You guys can go back to this chat, and you're gonna see how social privacy is, because, like several people kind of gave their opinion and how they feel about privacy and what is privacy for them, and a kind of more intimate, more individual level. And each person said this: All the people here. They say they said different things. You guys said different things
right? So for some people with isolation for them, for another one is to be able to monitor the information that's out there about themselves, you know, for other people. It's just, you know.
It's not not being seen, you know, to be like in in in hide, I mean so like, say, various people. So if there is within this class.
like the understanding of privacy, it varies within Canadian society, and if we were to go broader and look at time and space, if there is even within Canada, you know, if we look back 100 years ago.
like the notion of privacy in Canada, like the general kind of notion, was one, and 200 years ago was more, and then 300. Me. You know it so essentially.
This concept, because it is a social concept. It is always changing.
and the like. The understanding of privacy today is not going to be the understanding of privacy tomorrow.
Okay.
and even you, as you grow in your life as you mature, all of us doing myself. Our understanding of privacy changes, you know. Perhaps now you know you don't do things that you like back in high school. You are like, oh, Jesus! How did I do that.
How did I expose myself like that? Right? Because your understanding of privacy change it from teenager hood into youth? Right? So you change it. So let me. Just see here in the chat
you can't have privacy. No one respected.
Hmm. Yes, true, I mean. But the thing is that that the idea that information is restricted. I mean it. It is everywhere. I mean to some extent Everybody's gonna to that to some extent. You know what I mean, like.
So what I want for now, Jessica is be don't don't go into like.
you know, don't think of privacy as at this, for now I mean as this absolute value. That is something always good.
you know, because again.
not necessarily can go both way and Don't think of surveillance as being something that all is always is bad for privacy, something that always intrudes on privacy, because that's not always the case. You You get the point. That's what i'm trying to kind of I'm. Trying to deconstruct, like the common knowledge that we have
about privacy, because the call knowledge is all priv is good, everybody wants privacy
not necessarily, and also another common knowledge of surveillance goes against privacy. Not necessarily.
Is this like making sense?
So look.
when you think about privacy, Usually you gotta think about the notions of public, and say that of public and private, because that those 2 notions, which is very geographical.
they help define what's private and what is public.
and that helps to define the notion of privacy.
Okay, so. And but those 2 notions of public, public and private, private. It changes to over time they choose our social concepts.
Okay. So i'm gonna go back to some example that I actually cited to you. I said that. But I didn't. I want to go back to that because I, wanna you know, make you guys memorize. So I told you that when I moved to China
in 2,001 what that was when I first arrived in China
to do my master's degree all my classmates. They were all Chinese. I was the only known Chinese person. So all my classmates
they were, you know. They had a very like China at the time. If, if it was funny, had the sense of uniformity people they were doing, you know.
very similar things, even like the color of like, you know, guys, they were always, you know, dressing black or brown, or, you know, some sort of dark color. And girls they were dressing kind of, you know, light purple, like just like this kind of p
that you see on the screen, or bege, beige, or, like, you know, like very light callers. And it was very uniform, and and the understanding of privacy was that I mean, you know, like the women, it was very gender based. So women they would be in front of each other
like that. That would be a of an issue they would exchange calling they would take. They would like
wash themselves in the evening before going to bed in front of everybody, their their their classmates. So imagine you, you
living in the dorms here at the of a, and then you know you, you, you know you wash yourself in front of your classmates, your your your roommates, you pee in front of them. Isn't that like for you for me at least, coming from Brazil. It wasn't even Canada us I was like.
Oh, this is too much for me. I can't do this, you know, and even I told you that, even like you know, popping was like there was no forest in the toilet, so you would actually go into the washroom, like, you know, next to your classmate.
Can you imagine this situation.
and this is a kind of more personal life, kind of more day to day life, experience, a more kind of scientific or or research related example would be, you know, for me as a researcher. It was very hard to do research in China, because to do research means
that you're going to survey someone. You're going to interview someone, and in the case of social sciences, and for them they are understanding.
Their information was private, and only the government which is public, could demand so for them to see a researcher. You know a master's students to ask them about their lives.
They didn't want to talk to me, not because I was a foreigner, that my classmates they had the same kind of problems, because in the Chinese mindset was okay. This is private information, and only the Government can have
my private information, and here in Canada is the opposite.
for perhaps you might be more likely to tell your about your life something about your life to you know. To me a researcher you're going to trust probably better me as a researcher than the Government than the police. Then you know some someone who is from the Government.
So what i'm trying to see here is that to show here is this kind of new ones, I mean, you know, and even China today. And it's so funny because China changes so much. It's a society that's what I like about China changes like.
you know. I mean what it took us 500 years to change China changed like.
you know, the equivalent of 500 years in the West. It happened like in in, you know, in in 4 decades in China. So China, so you are able to see society changing, which in in the West you cannot, because you would have to live for a 100 years 300 years, you know, to be to see kind of major major changes.
So in China also. Another thing that today is different. When I go back to China I see all the the toilets they have doors, you know. I mean, you know, like in the countryside china, people used to share a bedroom like a not only not on a bedroom. Sorry, I said wrong. They used to share a bed.
So parents and kids, they would all asleep. There was this very large large beds, and underneath they would. They would put Poll to heat to work because there was no heater in the country sign. That was 2,000. You know the years of 2,005,
and and they would all kind of sleep together. So let's suppose the parents they want to have some sex. For example, there's no privacy right like
because of the geography of the bed. There's no privacy. Everybody's there together. So how do you do you? You wait until the kids go to sleep, and then, you know, if you want to do something you do in a hidden way. Right? So it's like that's that was, you know. I'm just giving you those examples. So you see.
But now you don't see that in the countryside anymore you don't you don't people don't share bad in China anymore, You know Chinese dramatically, and if you share bad with someone now in the countryside. It would feel the same as in Canada if I if I visit you guys, and then you know
you. I remember when I went to the countryside for the first time.
a friend of mine I mean not a colleague of mine, wasn't even my friend. I went to her house. And then I said, okay, there is just one bed. There's just like 2 beds, your 2 bedrooms like your parents and and this one here. So would you like me to sleep in the couch, you know, and or I can. I can do something here, rug or something, so I can sleep on the floor. She was like No, no, no! You sleep with me.
and then I was like.
Oh, how do I go about this thing right like for me. It may I? I indeed we share the bad, but I I felt super super uncomfortable, because my understanding of privacy is embedded in me, that I mean that sleeping is a private section
that i'm not supposed to to do that with people that are. You know that I barely know. Do you guys get what i'm saying? Are you guys in there? Is it making sense to you or everybody is gone? Let me see.
So is it? I mean
It's interesting. Isn't it like when we think about those things. Now you're gonna i'm gonna put you to think even more about this transformation, because this whole chapter is about like is about this idea of trying to put in your mind to show you.
You know how this notion of privacy changes, and that's why I don't want you to think that it is a a fantastic value, because you know it changes. I mean, it's something that keeps changing.
and he has to do with the understanding of public and private
perfect. Okay. So let me just see this last.
Yes, Nicole, you're very, very right. Okay. Very right. China changed a lot because of the money that they have now. So look at this family. Let's talk about family. And again, here I am going to follow the structure of the reading. Okay, family.
So let's go in there very quick. I'm going to summarize the reading for you. So look, family people.
family.
I'm gonna actually start here, family.
the way that we used to form family to marry, you know.
It was before, like not a long ago, like, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, depending on the country
or the area of Canada. For example, we used to form families based on love. No, there was no law. It was about economical interests, economic interest, religious interest, politics, social
even like you need. Yet today, you know, we have the caste system in India. So how do you marry? It is about money. It is about religion is about social. It's more cast. Oh, but I love someone with Strong. No, you're not going to marry that person right? So so you know. So, family you like, you know. You should be very kind of public.
like the way that we form family. He had to do with our parents. He had to do with their interest. He had, he had to do with the interest of the community. So it was sort of public.
And now families they are, you know, the idea of forming a family, you know, if they can, private, it's no longer public.
I mean it's about you if you love, or if you don't love all Marcella. But I am in Canada and my my parents they are from. Let's say Sri Lanka, and and they, you know they still kind of, even though they are in Canada. They they think that I should marry someone from my cast. Yeah, I mean that that has with the immigration. You know, the disparity mindset integration.
But yeah, but because you know what's nice about those examples that sometimes I hear in class is that you can see, like you know, 2 kinds of understanding of family, you know, like one that is kind of families private, another one of families public in the same country in Canada. Right? So so let me just go back in here. So sexuality people
your sexuality. When I see sexuality, i'm not talking about sex talked about sexuality and not
like it. It is a now it is a per a matter of personal choice. It is a matter of individual identity. You guys take that for granted because you are 20. You are 2122 2325, you know. But if you were 40 or above 30 you would not take that for granted.
Okay, before. It was not like that, you know, even like this script, the way that you made the way that you rate.
You know people the way that you it's all personal. The best example that I can think about is tender. Look at tinder.
It is all about like you is all about your taste. It is all about like what you like, and what you just like it is about your identity.
you know.
So we have Greer here. I remember how hard you was for a woman, for a young queer won't be. Oh, yes, exactly. It's very hard, because there was 0 space for this idea that oh, I want to be myself. No, no, no! If you have, you know a female Jennifer you're going to marry, and that's it. If you have me and you're going to be my Mary opposite Jenny. That's it. And there's no change. There's no nothing. There's no identity, All but I cannot be who I am your problem. And if you want to go back in Canada, and you know Alberta is too late.
Sterilization act. You could even be deemed, you know, a meal like a unwell, or you know mentally you and you could be sterilized. Right? So so, anyway. So
so look
the idea that family
can be formed based on emotions which is a very, very new idea that you guys take for granted.
It even changed the way that we define family in Canada. This is I have for here this slide, this slide
and this line, those 3 lines they are I I I went out of my way to show you, and I took for you to the the official definition of family. According to statistics, Canada.
So you see, in 1,949, a family was a group of parents and children characterized by common residents, economic corporation reproduction. So if you are parents, and you don't reproduce.
you are not a family
That was 1,949 in Canada, so we'd look at like later. I'd like you guys to read those, but we expedite, you know. And now look at the definition.
Our family Canadian statistics, Canada from 2,016.
Look at how broad this definition is. As i'm talking to you. Please take a look at this, you know. Skim through it. I mean. It's extremely broad, and you pretty much is almost like, okay, I I I can call anyone who I want to call family.
you know. So essentially the family became a private matter all myself. But my parents from Sherland are from Brazil or from yeah. I mean, they are exceptions, obviously, but I mean in general. That's we're talking about trends. That's the Trendy Society. Okay?
So.
Marcel, Why are you talking about family again? Because i'm trying to show you how privacy.
the notion of privacy evolved in society, so family was public. Now it's private. So whatever it was, privacy and public change it. When we talk about, you know, a family.
So
so far, so good people.
any comments, any anything, anything that you know.
Okay, i'm gonna keep going. I I like to just to ask a favor, because I don't have my cell phone in here, and I want to go fetch, and I don't even know where that is when it's like 5 min to finish. Just can you just tell me on the chat or so? It's 5 min down time? Okay.
Body, let's talk about body
again. I'm going with the text. Okay, so just make it easier for you to dissect and understand the text.
So, body people is private today.
Think about. Give me an example. Give me some evidence that the body is private.
Valencia. Yeah, as I understand you.
Yes, it can be irritating. And and people
tell me here, I mean, give me some evidence that shows that the body is private.
Yes, wonderful. We wear global thingss. What else?
Yes, Jessica.
Let's get to the sexual south domain.
There is this idea, that of consent. The very idea of consent People is built on the assumption that the body is private. Do you agree with me?
This whole idea of consent that we have now in in Western countries, like not all of them, but many of them, it Canada. We do have that. I mean nobody can have sex with you, you know. Accept that you you on a on you give consent.
You're not allowed to by the wall. Right? So that that is built on the idea that that's the evidence that today's private buy is private
ability to make all those decisions about your body as true. True, this is true. You can, you know I can make a talk to. I can put on a piercing I can. I can pierce my my ears. I can cut my hair. However, I want it was not like that before.
Well, women, they would have to have to wear long hair, man, short hair, you know some period of time, beard some periods of time. No beer beer less, you know. Like to, you know, like some some periods of time. You you could, you know you're supposed to have a year ring in some societies who do some Besides, you don't, you know, like you know, and you like. It's almost like your body was conditioned by the gender that you had, and and in the social class, and you were born in so me you had pretty much no freedom over your body.
Now, again we take this for granted.
like even like the outfits that we wear.
we are free. We but we don't realize how how free we are, or we are autonomous when we choose our outfits every day in the morning. But that was not the case, like, you know.
30 years ago it was not the case 30 years ago.
Okay.
So look
here, people, look it's just an example of how it was not always the oh, oh, hold on a second!
If you go back!
The body was public People
was a public site, a public space almost.
And that's why, when you go back to Greece in time, if we were going to go back 2,000 years ago, you know, like this guy that you see here. By the way, this is a very famous sculpture. It is in in Naples, the Museum in Naples, in Italy, and this is Hercules, I think, in English is here. At least that's how you say
so. I mean that kind of sculpture, I mean, if they expect from 2,000 years ago. That was, you know, normal, I mean, that was the example of a beautiful body, and and then the body was public was something to be shown. We don't do. I mean, we don't even like, you know.
some some some parents, when they take children to do a museum. I've seen it. I've seen it actually in Europe, like parents taking, you know, in in in Paris, I mean the very famous Move Museum. They have a lot of like naked, you know, statue like statues like that. And you see parents kind of, you know, feeling awkward, you know. Sometimes I love watching those things like it's mid surveillance on the people who go, you know, to see. So I kind of, I think, about no visibility body all those things that are discussing, and I watch.
So you see that families are all uncomfortable because that is not longer the case, right like.
So
I had some notes here, and I just see something.
Yeah. So. And you know, in in Greece
the only type of body that was hidden was whatever was the ugly body according to the standards all the time the ugly body at that time would be the body that you have muscles, right like.
Okay. So
look even like the idea of the idea of going to the washroom.
This idea that I talked I I gave my personal example by China.
but even in the West, you know, until, like the late nineteenth century
people would go the toilet like I mean, I gave you some nice team, which is how toilet, but like oh, obviously at that time toilet toilet. They were just holes, you know, somewhere, you know, like or just the bush depending on where you lived right at the time, but like this idea that you know you go like we have this very private idea.
and i'm gonna say some funny things here. But I mean it. I mean, think about in Canada and elsewhere in the Western world.
We even see the order rent for for bad smell from the from the toilet.
Right? So I do have some friends in Canada. They are. When they go they have to go into Washington. They are not there, sick or something they are concerned about.
you know, like the smell. They're concerned about the noise I have heard I mean I the When I teach my students they tell me fun stores. I'm going to share with you. So those stars I collect them in class with people, you know we discuss those things.
but, like I, I hear of people that they when they go in the Washington school especially, they have their favorite washroom because they want to privacy. You know. I hear of people that they throw some paper on the toilet, so there's no noise there's no splashing. So you know people, humans. They do all sorts of crazy things to ensure their privacy
when they go in the washroom. But that wasn't the case. You know those actually, they were not private, and I and that's what I like about China. I had the chance to actually experience China in a period when you know that was not private, and I felt later. I used to like a couple of years. Now I was like I don't care, I mean, you know, but like. But you know, when I first arrived it was very hard for me.
and I could feel the weight of society me telling me this is very.
This is too public for you
sex people. Sex is another topic in the book in the in the reading. So i'm i'm. Kind of I broke by, you know, by by the titles. So sex is another one
when we've sex people has always kind of been private, I mean, if you even if you look back to couple of 1,000 years ago, I mean, sex has always been something that's private.
But, however.
I mean the privacy of sex, it depended. It depended
on the amount on on social press. Just the example that I gave you about the bad in China.
and that's why I have this pack of.
I couldn't find a better picture, but I think this one's gonna stick to your mind. I mean, think about the wife and the husband and a lot of kids share the same bed in China. Just just example that I give you, I mean obviously rich people. They have spare rooms where they could go and have sex. But for people they did not
right, so they would have sex, you know they would try to get some privacy somewhere in the push of Don't know where, but but also sometimes it would happen in a public setting like in the bedroom. They had more people over, so it doesn't mean that it's gonna go crazy. No, I mean people would. Heights, too, you know. Do it right to it as silent as possible.
So so this is an example that you know
of how kind of like surveillance and the idea of privacy. How that intersects with social class, you know.
So for the rich people no problem for the for for people it can be a problem home. The home is another site
which Daniel they offer used to think about privacy and and and and
you know, like how privacy change it. So we tend to think of the home
as
Oh, I put the slide in the wrong one.
No, this is out of order.
Sorry people like before we talk about all i'm gonna I'm gonna have to revise the slide before we talk about home. Let's just talk about this slide. Here we have 2 slides. Talk about. I I misplace them.
So let's just go back before we talk about home. Let's continue to talk about sex or sexual life. So look.
even though sex. I told you that sex has been something that has fairly much been like, you know, you know. Always kind of private, you know, like I just told you that. However.
there is some sort of like like not always. I mean it's not. I mean, you know. For example.
if you were deviant in terms of like your sexuality, I mean, if you deviate from the norm.
whatever was the norm, the norm, like back in the in time was, you know, if you were a woman. You're gonna marry a guy. So if you were a woman and you had, you know, an affair for another woman that would be a deviation back in the days right like in some countries.
even this day, that the deviation can be punished. But like. But in Canada, back in the days and here Canada, us and Europe so so. But even those of sex was private.
That did not mean that you could do whatever that didn't mean that. Oh, I you know, since it's kind of it has been private for a long time. I'm gonna go and have sex with my my friend, who I love. No, that doesn't work, you know, so like any kind of deviance, was harshly punish right like. So
keep this in mind. Oh, I my slides there all to order. Geez.
I skipped some of them, I think.
Okay. So yeah. So anyway, i'm gonna put them in the right order. But like, so we're talking. We we continue to talk about sex. So I gave here again. I mean the the Sterilization Act in Alberta is the best example that I can give you of people being punished
for their sexuality, or because a lot of the people who were deemed ill. They were Lgbtq. 2 plus people, you know a lot of them indigenous people, as we discussed
indigenous women as as we discussed, but also Lgbtq 2 plus. But obviously at that time there was no it was just homosexuals, right? That was the kind of the the terminology. So I gave here from you just like I really like this article
that was actually written by Jenna Greco. She's a professor at the Us. Criminology, and this is not for the exam. People. It's just so. You know that in case you want to like, dig deeper into this sterilization act in Alberta?
Take a look at this article. Okay, because she does all those archive or information that I told you about that. It is at the Alberta Museum. She analyzes them. Okay, and it's a it's a good article. So
i'm not saying here.
I told you that.
Yeah, I mean, if they are like all displaced. I'm: so sorry.
So we talked about sex. Let's go back to talk about the body, because I mean, you know those lies there actually about the body. I don't know what I did here, you know.
anyways, body. So we're gonna flip back to body. Just so. I can talk about this ideas in here. So look.
But I told you guys, that body is now private, and you you agreed with me on the chat.
But even though it's private, we do have, like abortion, is still a super contentious issue. Super
here in Canada, even you know, in the United States. But here in Canada we do have protection over abortion. But in the United States now we're going back
like that. Protection has been removed, you know. So not not fully, but like now it's it isn't the power of the state of the the the the States, not the not the Federal government. But this the State Government, not because here we call provision right, but like there's State.
so it hasn't been removed the protection fully. But now it is up to the State to determine if they're going to cover. If you're going to be providing for for a choice, right? So so so we still. So I mean why I brought this here.
It's about control. Yes, and why did I bring this here? Because I want to show you that I mean society. So essentially i'm telling you look privacy. The idea of privacy. It's changing.
but sometimes it doesn't change like in a linear way it doesn't go like, you know.
like always know. Sometimes it goes. It comes back a little bit. Here. It changed, you know. Sometimes it change regarding sex, but it doesn't change regarding body, you know. So it's a lot of contradictions which is fine. I mean, that's what society is right. Like. Society includes a lot of contradictions.
So another another one about the body is the be true movement. Right? That, I mean is an example of how you know the body is becoming more private. But again, you know. And now we go back to home. So yeah, so you see, I have to fix this slide. But anyways.
so home people
used to be. You know it has been a private kind of setting for a long time.
and if you read the article, you're gonna even see that home like our homes.
I mean they were castles right like you did this like if you travel with France is the best example for you to see this. I mean, you're gonna sell a lot of castles. I mean, the home was a cancel.
right? So we usually tend to forget that, you know we think of it's almost like in our minds castles. They became a category in themselves. But no, but they are homes, their houses. It's just that we don't build them that way anymore, but their homes
right so, and it's like they have been a private setting for a long time.
But here, you know, it. It varies up to money as well. Not everybody obviously had the money to build a castle. Okay, so
so for for people who are poor, I mean.
you know they don't have any privacy in their home. I mean their home was like shared, and you know, when they had to leave I mean, you know they have to use whatever facilities that they had. But now it is, you know, we tend to think of our homes as as more private right like. However, even though they're very rich people.
or you don't even have to be that reach but a lot of people you usually reach.
They have, like a you know, in their homes they have an office. Well, now, if the pandemic you changed everything. Anyone has an office, even me. I have an office here like in my place, but, like you know, which is not even my place is. An so you know it's, an that has an office. So it's like, you know. See how popular, dedicated to the pandemic, but, like you know, but like essentially like a lot of the like higher income classes, people, they have a library in their houses, and, like they have, like a home Home Office spot, and it uses the library for kind of work, classy.
And then that library is where, if you ever need to conduct any kind of private bill, a public business in the house, you'd do it there.
So let's suppose You are a business person here in Edmonton, and you are reaching. You have a library. You have some sort of like steady in your house, and then someone comes to talk to you about whatever business you're not gonna have them over dinner like in the in at the dinner table. You might give them dinner. But you're gonna, you know. Invite them to this study so you can, you know, have this kind of discuss this this topic. That is, it is private for you, but it's a public topic. It's not like about your family. It's about business, business, business life, right? So
So
also another thing that I want to add is that.
like this understanding of
like.
If we go back to medieval Europe
like people, they would live near castles, and they would have like the rich people, and they would have everything inside of their cancels. They would have like a barn. They would have everything in there, I mean, if you ever visit a castle? You have everything in there.
But then, you know at that time, I mean.
and people in poor people would just like live wherever they could find, you know, very simple accommodations or houses.
and then we fast forward a little bit. We go into the Industrial Revolution.
and then in the Industrial Revolution. This idea of castle it became kind of, you know too much. I mean it's too kind of inconvenient for the reach. So the rich kind of they change the way that they live. And the poor also changed the way that they live.
And and and this idea that you know that separation between usually the poor people. They move to the city with the industrial Revolution.
When you look at the history of the Uk, all the countries and and in the regions, you know, there is like an influx of migration to the cities Manchester, London, I mean, they're all suited to that. They were developed with rural migrants. They all came to work in the factories, you know, work like, you know.
in industry. And and then there was like a greater separation of this understanding of public and private regarding the home. So it's almost like, until the Industrial Revolution, the notion of public and and and private
or privacy involving the home for the reach was very blurry because they had the castle, for the poor also was blurry, because, you know, they would live work everything in the farm, in the you know, in the rural areas, agricultural life for the poor people, and after with the industrial Revolution.
both for poor and reach this idea of home being organized around like, or as a private space, it became more
it become. It became more obvious. So you know even the poor people. They have their homes, and then, like, if I was slow at the beginning, was like you do everything there. But then, slowly, with the emerges of emergence of factories. People would sleep in there in their homes during the day time, and during this the night time, and go work in a factory. So that was this division of of of
of labor. If you will, you know in that space called home you do certain things in that space called factory or workplace. You do all kinds of things. Is this clear folks?
Yes, no. Come on. Where is everybody?
Okay, Yes.
So look
So what I put in Here is some money for you, because what I always all everything that I said about the family at the house.
You know it. It it it's tied to money, I mean, you know you need to have money to have, you know, up a castle and and have everything in there. You need to have money to have, you know, a a place, and have a a study in, and or a library in your house, and stuff like that, right? So it goes according to money, and the last topic is communication.
Okay. So again, we take for granted that our correspondence is private. We don't think about that. It could be even otherwise.
But it wasn't
private until I would say, need eighteenth century. Okay, eighteenth century goes from 17, one all the way to 1,800 right? So that's that's the seventeenth century.
Oh, sorry! That's the eighteenth century. So I said, I said, 18 is right like mid eighteenth century.
Is that what I just said
Come on, people.
are you guys there.
hey? I'm gonna say it again. So it wasn't into around 1750, which is mid eighteenth century that our communications they became private. Okay.
So look sorry. Just sometimes it just go, you know, because if it feels like you're talking to the walls right like it's like you feel Sometimes I feel I was very used to teaching the pandemic
like online. But then, after I mean, now, I kind of. I feel weird again, just like in the beginning, when we first start, You know I feel like man. There's nobody here, you know. Is there anybody out there, you know, like, or I feel kind of crazy, you know, like Anyways.
thank you. Thank you for letting me know.
How could you have a communication breach in this. Yeah, people, would they would take you again? There was not that understanding that the letter that someone sent to you was yours, I mean anybody would read. So so let's suppose someone gives me a letter for Jessica
and say, is Marcel let's because i'm your mother, Jessica. This is a matter for you, for for for your, for your daughter. And I would go and say, Well, okay. And then I would just open up and read
that that understanding that a letter is something confidential, it wasn't there and then slowly, that understanding appeared in society and slowly, we created loss. Okay around that.
Yeah, exactly that. So
a lot to actually, now that you're talking, Jenna, there's I mean I I I don't know if I told you guys, my P. A. Is a social sciences. I have a triple major, including anthropology in anthropology. There's a lot of work on the on gossiping medieval times. You know. Actually, it's a very interesting topic. Anyways.
so communicate here, people.
Oh, I said, let me just think
i'm just think, because like it's 17 something. So I I put it role. I'm gonna fix this slide to, because it's eighteenth century, because eighteenth go from 1, 7, 0, one all the way to 1,800. So it's it's not 17, but 18. So i'm gonna fix this year.
Look.
I like to put this for you to think about it. I don't know if you guys are, are kind of, if you know that, like like the guy, Prince Harry from England.
from the Uk. He you go. He put it all the book, and I became very interested in the whole.
like discussion around the book. Because I kind of agree
with what Vanity Fair just said in there, I mean.
there is like people who like and dislike Harry and Megan I mean, you know the the people like the the royal family, and etc., etc. for me doesn't that doesn't really matter. I mean whatever you like, or just like. But what I found it's interesting is that they are trying, and those 2 they are trying to kind of re signify, reorganize
the concept of privacy when it comes to media and communications in England, in the in the whole Uk. Actually
not only in England. So so they are like, you know, so essentially like, so like you, Harry put out this book called spare. He's studying his story, and and and he's discussing media media like the way that they needed to to him they way that that the royal family uses the media. When is okay, when you know when it's like, you know. Kind of he's trying to draw those lines like, you know.
when Royal Family should talk to reporters, and when they should not talk to reporters, you know it's like it's almost like he's trying to draw his line. You know a line of the sand, and from what I got I gathered
It's it's almost like you're saying, you know it is okay. I mean, you know, I mean, I want to. I want to have access to the media. The media is a source of money for the royal family. And of course, yeah. So it's essentially well down to money. It's a it's a source of money and sustainability for the royal family. However, you know he's complaining. Okay, we should
benefit. But you know it's not okay when you get. You know things that are that I don't want up there. So it's kind of this debate.
You know him trying to draw this line on the sand, or what's right. What's wrong
that I find that very, very interesting for people with that surveillance. So, anyways, essentially, I just want to bring that up, because I don't know if if you guys are following, you know, if you know what's going on. But you know, keep an eye on there for that
and my final message for you. I hope I have one more. Do I have one more minute, people, one more minute or no. My time is up.
Okay. Great. Okay. Final message for you.
Very easy. So easy message. So the message here is society changes and we change our understanding of privacy as well as our laws around privacy
or some. But that's it. Yeah. So the guy like Daniel took a couple of pages like, you know, at the 10 pages, just to show you and I try to kind of reproduce all the themes that he talked about, just to show you, because when we first came, when you guys first come to the class to class, and I tell you it's almost like we all of privacy.
We don't think about privacy, and we all believe that privacy is always good.
Right? So
and and so i'm trying to kind of know. Look, Privacy is a is a social concept. It keeps changing. So Don't get too much attached to that, because probably by the time that you guys are old, I mean, you know that, like you're gonna see in your grandchildren
or in your relatives younger relatives, Another kind of understanding of privacy in the same way that I that I saw in China, you know. So keep that in mind. And then next class we're going to talk about like privacy loss.
E: including here, like the tax is more global. But i'm gonna bring stuff from Canada. Okay.
So i'm going to switch those slides back to the right? Position.
And and i'm going to re-approve them to e class.
That's all.
Thank you very much. I hope that this was like enjoyable, not too painful. And and thank you very much. Guys for coming. And you guys take care of yourselves. Mental health.
physical health study, you know.
Keep things in check. Not at all for my class, for everything, you know. Good luck with whatever you have to do and take care of yourselves. Okay.
you have a great day to people. If you have any questions to stay on the line.
I'm going to stop recording, but you stay on the line if you have any question.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
"










Jan 31

"Hello, everybody! Do you guys hear me? Do you see me? Well.
welcome back.
You have 18 people here live.
Let me see if it's recording and everything.
No, just double check. If this thing is recording.
Yeah, it is
sorry, folks.
Okay.
Okay. So
do you guys see me and this screen, or you see something else you're supposed to see, just like the Ppt. And my face. Yes, both. We're good. Then right like.
Okay, Good.
Okay, people. I, our colleague, shared something very nice with me today. Interesting?
Well, it's not pleasant, but it's really interesting. Is that, like there is this person in the United States that he was Scott like he murdered his wife, and he was Scott because of his Google searches.
So it's really interesting to take a look at it. And when I got Hannah's email I was like, okay.
I actually even replied to her that this is very nice. Thank you. And and and that's exactly why i'd like you guys to think of surveillance to kind of analyze surveillance. Not so much
just like try to think of the surveillance as bad or good, because sometimes surveillance is just excellent. Imagine if you were the family of that woman who was murdered, and now you, you know you know exactly what happened to her, because you know of the Google Search is that you know that the police, you know, got from the husband. So you know. So surveillance is, it's like, Of course, in society we on a personal level, we sometimes we we hate surveillance. Sometimes we love surveillance, or sometimes we just don't care about surveillance, but like
but for us here in this course, I mean my whole goal with this, you know, like
like teaching this course to try to kind of get people thinking about surveillance and
and and and understanding how surveillance works and and all those things. Not so much if it's good or bad. Okay, so take a look. It is on, you know, on on our e-class. I have a little section on the top of the page right like, you know, it's the second kind of section that I have in there with like resource that people send me. So you're gonna find the video in there as a short kind of t news video about this case. Okay, good. So today, oh, actually.
I notice last class. I noticed that I forgot
to go like, because sometimes I you know, I don't know why, like on zoom calls like sometimes you're passing the slides, and these like they stick together like they, you know. Sometimes you pass one, but it goes to so they are like one or 2 slides that I didn't talk about it.
and so i'll go back later. It doesn't have to be now. Later on, you you know i'll pass them, and I'll I'll let you make some notes about less class. Okay. So today, people, we're gonna continue to discuss privacy.
and we're gonna start. We have 2 topics to discover, to discuss and and discover. And the first one is a Ted Talk by Glenn Greenwald. I don't know if you ever heard of this name. Do you guys know Green?
Or a green wall like Glen Green. Wall, do you know this journalist? Anybody here? Have you heard of this guy before?
Yes, no
people.
Are you guys there?
Okay, You say, No? Okay. So yeah. So this guy is a very famous American. Oh, apparently not that famous American journalist. And he got the pool to a prize like a couple of times, and once actually, it's a very big prize in journalism. And another thing that I mean, he found it a society called
the Intercept.
You know it's called the output here in the chat, just for you know, intercept. So this is like he has this O. Ng.
and Joe, I think in English Ngo. Yeah, the Non Government organization. So he has intercept, and like the whole purpose of this organization, which now has branches all over, like in pretty much a lot of many countries is kind of to expose corruption exposed like dirty politics, so he's a very famous journalist, and by chance I mean, you know he is based actually in Brazil, where I am from.
He's American born and raised in the United States. He's been everywhere in the world, but he, he for his husband. He married a guy from Brazil. So and this actually his husband is a a member of the Parliament in Brazil, Lower House, you know, like Congress, but not Senate, like the House of Representatives, the Lower House.
And
and so he married this guy, and he's been in Brazil for quite a bit, and he's doing some like his organization is doing awesome work in Brazil, exposing corruption. Okay, like. And the way it works is like, you know, people's it's like a kind of a leak. You know thing that you know people leak information in there, and he uses of his.
you know, journalist status to protect the person who licked the document, and and then he writes about it, and he exposes like a piece of corruption. So so we're gonna watch a Ted Talk by this guy, and he is a very
and like he's I mean he's not as famous as Snowden, which probably you heard about because he licked
like huge amounts of of material from the from the Us. Government in the website, on the on the Internet. So probably you heard about Snowden, but but he's not as famous, but he's I mean he. They They know each other, I mean, they work kind of together. It's part of this big
web of people who, you know, are trying to fight for, you know, to make politics more open to the public. Okay.
So we're gonna watch his Ted talk. I'm gonna. I have a few questions about the Ted Talk to you. We're gonna work together, and then we're gonna, you know, Discuss a Join our article. So let's start with the podcast, the the Ted Talk. So i'm not sure it's gonna be my first time ever
using a zoom call to broadcast something. So i'm gonna play. We're gonna walk together.
But i'd like you to let me know in the chat if you don't see, or if you can't hear. You know. You'll tell me on the chat on the chat. Just check myself on working whatever, because I've never tried this before. Okay. So now i'm gonna stop sharing this screen here. Oh, and one more thing.
Can you see now, it's the time that doesn't pass like
Hold on a second
Here.
I would like to ask you people come on. I'd like to ask you
when you are watching it's a 20 min, 1520 min that talk when you're watching. I would like you to consider those 3 questions that you see in front of you
like the for the question Number one. What happens to us
when we are under surveillance. So you know, consider that. Think about that as you're listening.
and and see if you agree with what he said. He's gonna say, see if you have anything else to add to that.
The second question here is, what role does privacy play in our lives? Okay. So why is privacy important. We've kind of discussed a little bit, but like you to listen to him. And how does privacy
benefit society at large? Okay. So keep you. You have this line, so keep that with you, and I am going to go in here and play.
You should be ready to go and just try again. Here, share a screen.
Okay, here we go. Let's see if this is gonna work.
Please let me know if that works.
You're supposed to. Here.
Hey, people hold on a second.
I don't think it's gonna work
your I'm just ask you very quick. Your pros. Have they any of them like, you know? Broadcast stuff to you like in the lecture like this.
Has anybody done that before in in any of the yeah. Okay. So maybe it's just me. I don't know how to put this thing. Hold on a second. I'm! Just one more.
One more channel, one more trial.
Let me see what you guys are writing here.
I couldn't hear your presentations muted
could be that your presentation is muted.
Is it because maybe it is because I have my ear plugs right like. Usually they give us a few moments to watch. Yeah, I think i'm gonna go cool that good to go. Do that, You know. I just see.
Oh, okay, I I'll try and mute myself, Jessica. Just one more time. People very quick. If that doesn't work i'll give you time. You guys go watch, and then we discuss. Okay. So let's just try one more time here.
you know, and i'm going to mute myself.
Oh, my! I'm sorry
you're currently on mute. Oh, my gosh, people.
this is like a nightmare. Okay, so so sorry, people. Okay, what I said is, i'm gonna give you guys 15 min. Everybody go in there in the link. Let's watch all together. Each person does it from your own computer, and then we come back here and discuss. Don't. Leave the room. Just stay here. Okay. Is that okay? Everybody Can we do that?
Okay, Good. Let's go. Okay, 15 min. It's 1516 min is going to be more than enough, everybody now starting now. I'm going to mute myself, but i'm here because i'm going to watch too.
8 people just let let us know when whenever you guys are done. Okay. So okay, let's just wait 3 more minutes. So
people
we can skip the Q. A: okay. We can skip that just just so we can save time. But
okay, folks, let's get back in here, please. Everybody.
So look.
first of all, Did you guys, Did you find it interesting.
Did you like it? I mean, did that speak to you? Anything that you wanna
that you want to kind of? You know that's something that you like, or something that you did did not like.
Just share way here. Okay, I'd like to bring some some stuff for you here that I that called my attention.
Obviously this idea of like bad and good. You like you have things to hide and or you don't have anything to high that's really interesting, and that's something that has not appeared in our in our well. It appeared in it now 1 one of the articles that we we talked about it like that, you know, like the
some ideas are on surveillance that you know you have to be carefully like those people say, you know i'm not afraid, because I haven't nothing to hide so. And but like here he explored that better kind of you know this kind of dualist view. Well, you're bad. You're good, and that is a very simplistic and yet appealing organization of the world.
This is easy to say, oh, you are bad, you're good. This is good, this is bad, right? So if if it's, if it's very well when people say, oh, I have nothing to hide there, for I don't care about surveillance, right? So that that kind of you know it. It it clicks with like, you know, the the mentality around that you know the way you organize the side.
Another thing here that before I get to the chat that i'd like to to share with you is that
I really enjoyed what he said about
what could the measurement? If you want to know? If a society is free, the measurement is to see not how the society treats like it's. It's good citizens.
But how society treats, You know people who are deviant people commit crimes and everything. So that's where we can see if a society is truly free, because I mean, you know, he has a do process, a criminal justice system, or a justice system for the people who you know who commit crimes. Right? So one more thing. Here.
here's a comment that I like to bring something out to you
when he talks about the panopticon. Probably you heard, and probably now you know what that is. He says he says, Look, Jeremy Bentham. He thought of the panopticon as originally designed to be implemented in prisons.
This is incorrect. Okay, this is incorrect, Marcella. What is incorrect, like like like a a glen, he said. The panopticon, like, according to bell from you know, like, was originally originally designed to be implemented in prisons, and you, you can know for a fact if you go back to my slides. When we discussed the panopticon. I gave you a a huge quote.
you know, from Benton.
like you know, about the panoptic, and he says it it. It. It's useful for hospital it's used. It's useful for a reason that kind of architecture can use can be used in in hospitals, so it is in in the slides, and also like I gave you that quote, and that's why I also bent them. He knew that that architecture was multi purpose, and he even called in S. Penoptica. The title of the book is an opticon or Inspection House.
because, again, it can be it. It is an architecture for inspection. Okay? And I think that that's it pretty much. Let me just go back in here. So people saying that it is interesting, a good talk. Okay.
I yeah, I I don't. Yeah, Emma. Yes, I see what you're saying about. Nothing to hide, You know, Greer. Also nothing to hide and the things connected back yet, you know. Yeah. Oh, yeah, Selena, this is media definitely media studies. But people look.
Let's think about those those questions here.
What happens to us when we are under surveillance? What he's trying to say is that we change the behavior. We change right, like we behave differently.
and and we we, we, when we know that we are under surveillance. It's almost like we become this controlled kind of individual.
and we do self control right? So it's almost like, okay, I am. We go into this mode, you know, just like you know, our cell phone has the, you know, sleep mode, we know, like, okay, I am in public kind of mode, and and sometimes people tell me my lectures over sell up when I see a camera. I am so used to that that I don't change. I am just. I am just myself. I mean nothing happens to me. Therefore what Glen is suggesting is not quite accurate, because I just don't change.
But then I asked the person like you most most time when when you are, you know when there is a camera you may believe that you don't change.
but you do because you are in public, and your behavior in public is not the same as your behavior
in private. So the thing is that the the of public to us today in today's society.
Get the concept of being in public
already includes dealing, knowing that you know people are watching you
You guys get what i'm saying like we know that I mean, you know, like 50 years ago, being in public, he meant that you know that people are watching me, and that that this is gonna die off. I mean, because at that time nobody had cell phones. Nobody had, you know, any way to kind of
do like the gather the information to the data collection. But in today's world with digital technology there are ways, you know, for people to gather information about us when we are in public. And therefore you know the idea of technology or the you know the the popularization of technology that now it's so popular. Everybody has a cell phone, and you know their cameras everywhere, private and public cameras, I mean in the public setting that changed our behavior already.
So
So sometimes people. They don't realize that they are already kind of equipped. It's almost like when we leave the house in the morning it's almost like our camera. Our public mode
turns on. But that idea of public being public in today's world, it means to be under constant surveillance. It means that you know there is always someone recording us. So so that's why we may believe that doesn't change us. Do I make sense what i'm trying to say Here.
I want people I want. You guys.
Do you feel what I'm saying that you know that to be in public in today's world means to be under surveillance, and therefore you know that may lead you to believe that. No, nothing happens, you know.
So the thing is that it's almost like we. We are much more programmed than we could ever imagine. That's the point.
Anything else to add. I mean, you know i'm i'm speaking here. But I I wish this was like a live. I would see you guys in person, because then you would get. But any anybody wants to, you know, feel free to No, no, not only to chat. But the mic if you, wanna you know, share anything about that, you know.
Okay, you come. You come if you want. So second question, what role does privacy play in our lives?
Let's see what Matthews say that quote who he who who does not move does not notice his change was for yeah. And this, Matthew, I don't know if you got that, because not everybody from either. That comes from
Rosa Luxembourg. So it comes from an author. Those in Paula Science. I know her.
She's her name is Rosa. Okay. She's an European I for about which country she's from. But obviously she died, and she was part of the very early waves of Marxism in Europe.
and but she's actually she's classified in so in science, as a as a as a I like her thoughts are are classified as as political science. Okay. So if you want to read her and she's labeled as an anarchist.
she's excellent. I mean, I. I read a lot about her when I was in my underground. I really like this offer. I find her extremely inspiring, and and you know, and also the fact that she's a woman at that time is, it calls attention, because at that time it was really rare to have. Like. You know, women in the you know, in the unions and labor movements, and you know Marxism, and like left wing movements in Europe. I'm talking about like early did the beginning of the twentieth century. Okay, so just so. You you keep that in mind
if you, if you're curious, you want to know more about her. But I also love that cold, you know.
And and but people here. What role?
Privacy, place?
Why is that important? Why is that significant?
The first thing that comes to mind for me. This is grew speaking about. Why, what what privacy plays and why it's important is my best friend. Just got our identity stolen.
because a while it was stolen, and they have.
She's it's she's constantly now putting out fires of people trying of somebody trying to get credit cards in her name and open up loans and stuff like that. So it's important, I think, not only because it's affecting her
financial.
her financials, and it's. And then it's also affecting her mental.
Of course. Yeah, of course, you know.
I would be like, yeah, I can. I can't. I can't understand that, you know. And and you're right. So you just like what what you're sharing about your friend. I mean it's it's only the future scale. It can compromise your economics, your your economical life, your your mental health, your you know stress levels. I mean, it's just awful. And you're very right, and I think
probably be you know you guys would have more stories about that.
You know, people being impersonated, you know, on the Internet. Stuff like that means just awful right, like. Or you see if we wanna go that far. We can even talk about porn hub, and how a lot of videos they end up in there. And can you imagine I mean, you know, so like, and that's another another whole process. I mean the another whole deal. If you want to take that to help like it, and it's all nearly impossible for people to get videos out of Port Hub and Porn. Hub is everywhere nowhere at the same time, and nobody has money to
file a lawsuit against them. Imagine right so, and imagine if you're a teenager, and then you know the toll on your mental health, it it's even bigger, and so thank you. And and and it was grace right like, Thank you, Grace, and and and indeed.
and and also we can take this question, brother, we can go, even brother, okay, like Macro Mac, or the the example that she said. And I, you know it's an example of a person. But if you think about society people.
we humans like the beauty of being a human is that is your creativity.
Think with me. What is it that makes us humans so unique.
It's our ability to invent our ability to create. That is the most like that's that's what makes it's almost like divine. This ability that we have to create new things, you know, to like to resist, to invent, you know to you know, in that ability is infinite.
right like, and that's what makes our brain so powerful. But the problem is for us to be this amazing creature that we are able to create
things we need a moment. I mean, we need a moment of silence, or we need a moment away, or we need a moment or an environment where we can be ourselves
right so, and and we can truly be who we are, right so.
and a lot of what we are. A lot of our identity has to do with the other. We build our identity, you know it's it's a callative kind of thing, I mean. I I am what I am in relation to you. So right now I am a Prof. Because there is there. Are you guys there, you know, you being the students, so that then we create this relationship, and that makes us be what I am and for you to be student, you need me the pro, so you can be the students. So if there is no pro. You cannot be this student. So anyways, our identity and home
we are is very much tied to to people. So we are social beings in that sense we need people. However, we also need time away, and we need you know that comfort that I mean that there is nobody judging me that there is nobody, because when we are in with others we are like it can be the profit, and be your mother, your parents, your sisters, your brothers, your whoever I mean.
You have roles. When you see people you play a specific role, so we need moments where you know we can just be and be, you know, in in in whatever way that we can be.
and it's almost like it feels that in today's society there is no longer that space, because, you know, like it's the Internet, the Internet of things it took over. And now we just don't have a life anymore that it's kind of
like it's pretty much like, you know. I don't know for you guys. But for me it feels like that all, almost every instance of my life, for every moment of my life
there is Internet, involved, or there is some sort of long
virtual situation happening at the same time. So it's almost like it's very hard now inside, and that's what Glenn is trying to say that I mean for us to be humans. It's almost like we don't have that space anymore. And we see the the problems of that with especially for teenagers, because
teenagers, they tend to be all the time on the Internet on social media platforms, and they are constantly thinking about
what others are are saying and talking and thinking about them. So you know, we see like a lot of like we see. I need a super high, a super big increase in in in the suicide, in in self harming, and and, like you know, all sorts of problems that we didn't have before. And and now we have this almost like super exposure all the time. And and when you are young that really affects your confidence. When you're adult, I mean sometimes it's easier. It might be easier, you know, to deal with.
but when you are young and you are forming your your brains to kind of your identity to building up. And you you have that, you know you never have privacy. Almost so in my do I make sense to you guys, I mean. So i'm trying to kind of, you know.
Steer some like, you know, make you kind of think about this that we need that moment, and if we don't have that moment, it's almost like
we can't be ourselves, and and our drool selves.
and or just you know, be whatever I mean, you know, and in that compromise our creativity, and it is almost takes away our humanity.
and that for society has, you know, a lot of consequences, because, you know, we need we humans. We need society. To live in society requires creativity and like for us to eat better, to do things better. We always need to be creative, even like for us to the advance, the economy.
regardless if it's going to be a capitalist economy, or whatever kind of economy, you know, like human creativity, which is, has always been there. You go in a museum. You go visit a museum, and then you see
all those tools that our ancestors they used to to make in order to cook tweet. And you see oh, my gosh, those guys! They were super smart, I mean, you know. And how do they come up with that? That's that's the human power. And and if we don't have that moment, I mean, how is that? So? That's where he's getting to? You know he's taking that preoccupation
broader, you know, from the individual, obviously just like Gray said. And I said about porn hug, I mean.
But you know, like broader like, you know. So like he and saying, Look, we're gonna create this Society of Zoom. Be where, you know.
you know, we are just like conforming, conforming. There is like, you know, we are not doing anything special or anything deviant like. We are not deviating from the norms or we are not. We're not doing anything that you know that that could be more creative, because you know, we know that you know, if I do this, you know it's gonna be a hassle here. If I do that, I mean.
you know. And sometimes we it's not even conscious. I mean, we just we just duplicate whatever society expects from us.
For me it looks very depressing. I don't know people. Are you guys there?
Because Here's the moment where I I feel like oh, my gosh! This is awkward! I'm talking to the walls.
It kills, it kills Anita.
It kills
it's! It's not so much the Anita. It's not so much to conform it itself.
but it is that frame, that that thing that you that you know it's. It's almost like it's not the the conform it itself that that kills creativity, but it's like you, but like those forces that make you all form, which the like being surveillance being one.
you know, so that
you know, if you are in your i'll give you a very practical example.
Let's suppose you are in your workplace. We're in your office, and you know that everybody is is like is watching. You know that. I mean, you know you know that you are under surveillance, and you don't really have any space to think in your office, and maybe you're not gonna try something that may look stupid.
Maybe you have an idea for something. I mean, you know you have. You want to do something different, and nobody has ever done in your office, in your in your for your employer in your firm, but you feel afraid if you walk, for you don't want to do it, because you know your your co-worker and the look at you, and you're going to say, oh, I need is stupid.
so you know, like you don't take that step. You don't push that edge, you know, because you know, because you're afraid that if things go wrong, people are gonna criticize you right like
when you get to yourself, Why would you want to live life as a lot. Yeah, but that's the point, right? Like what he's trying to say is like Glen is a guy
that this is the the guy who gave the talk. I mean he's pushing. He's pushing against that he's saying, Look we as humanity, we cannot accept a society where you know where we are under surveillance all the time, because
you know, it's taking away our humanity. It's taking away our our desire to live. I mean, because yeah, you might be dead as well you might you might, you, you know, if we cannot be truly humans, why do we live right? I mean, i'm making philosophy here right so why why would we? So that's what he's trying to to get you
So I don't know. I find people that I mean. You know this guy has a point somewhere in there that I mean you know it's. It's it's even like that for the economy. Let's let's think. Let's suppose that we were Bill Gates, or, you know, Mark Zugenberg, or that we were, you know, Eric Schmidt from Schmidt, from Eric Schmidt from Google.
I mean, if we were like some big big capitalist, extremely rich. We would still want. I mean, we we would. Okay. I want people. I want my employees to make money for me.
I need to give them space
because they need to be deviant. They need to be creative, creative. They need to kind of push the envelope, but for them to do that, you know they need some space, and that's why people, large corporations, a lot of them. They even have, like they have a gym for employees, you know they have like, you know you can. You know you can have like a forgotten English, how you guys call there's a name like a breakout, a breakout kind of room where you can go and relax. You know they like some of the kind of more richer companies they give you.
you know, a nice fridge with like, you know, with food, you know, chocolates, I mean. They give you nice foods, you know, like things that, you know. So they try to make you happy. So you know. So you can kind of, you know. And that and and one thing that I really liked about Steve Steve Job.
They got his jobs. I can't remember. His name is Jobs, or whatever the guy Steve Jobs that i'm sure you guys know from from Apple the guy would best.
I I think I mentioned this before, like there is an interview with him that I like a lot
that he discusses. You know, the secret of apple, and he says, Look, the secret of apple is to allow people to be creative, truly creative, to allow them to kind of. I'm gonna try this thing if it doesn't work, and if I lose, if I was some materials, it's fine, you know, like it's like, give people space.
So so, even like, you know, if you are a very smart capitalist, you should kind of keep in mind that I mean
that space is important. I mean, the privacy is important, right? So
so people.
is that okay? Can we move on any comments? Anything you want to jump in and say, feel free to if you want.
hey? We're gonna we're gonna keep moving. So we're gonna move now to the
to this new, You know, to this additional text that we have this text to is a journal article. It is by this guy here called Bennett, and he's a prof at Universal Victoria. And yeah, Grace, this article is actually a thing on the neck.
you know. I'm really happy on the like. I was when I saw, like the the. And I got from Dr. Hackers like oh, man, I don't want to use this, but then I kind of if I did some reflection on my own. Here's like. No, I i'm gonna go. I'm gonna use this because there is a point to be made here.
And then you're gonna get, you know. So I I will guide you. The nice thing is that i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you today where you're going to read for the exam. I'm gonna make you just read like 3 pages of it for the exam. Okay, and in the probably with the contacts that I give to you today, it's going to be more than enough enough. But we're still a Why do you make us read this this thing? Because this guy here
he is the only he's a Canadian scholar, and he is the only scholar who is actually thinking about the governance of privacy.
Okay, so. And that's why he's so important. So that's why you guys need to know. You need to know that this guy exist. You need to know that his ideas are out there, and it's actually obvious. I don't know why it's just academic sometimes. They right so like, you know
they don't write well that's the reality, you know, and it gets bored. So let me break this to you. Okay, so look, we're gonna talk a little bit about the governance of privacy
for those involved. The science might be easier. This this lecture, because I mean, you don't want governance. So we're talking about the way that privacy is regulated the way that we control the way that we guide Privacy Society. Okay, so so there is. There is a governance of privacy out there. So last class last class I gave you guys. We talked a lot about privacy, and how privacy evolved. And I told you. Look, the idea our understanding of privacy changes right.
You change according to culture according to time and space. So you know it's something that keeps changing. But the Government, you know, tries to like, organize, and and govern and regulate privacy.
and that's exactly what we're gonna look at. See how that happens in this text. And when I say privacy here in this text, what I mean by privacy is
personally identifiable information. That's what we're we're gonna we're gonna get more kind of legal today. More kind of you know, like talking about policies. So so he is in his interest. Interested, like Bennett, is interested in understanding how how personally identify when information is protected.
So there is some sort of governance in there for that. So let's understand how this happens, and you're gonna see it's pretty easy. So here some of some ideas for you. Look.
we have like, how do we govern privacy.
We have policies
or
tools of governance. Okay, so, but not like tools of governance, is a nickname for policies is actually a full codeian nickname. Full call, Michel, for the guy that we studied before he used to call policies. He used to refer to policies as tools of governance. Okay, so just like. So this author here he also draws in full call. So that's why he says tools of governance. So look we. We have. Obviously every country
has policies about privacy. Okay, and so that you know. And this. So this is something that you need to keep in mind of. This is obvious. But Don't forget ever that those policies they are tied to culture. They're They're tied to people's understanding of of of privacy. They are tied to, you know, to deal with regulatory traditions, like the way that the country makes policies itself, you know.
and political culture so anyways like. So each
like, you know, each country has its own governance of privacy
like this. Text talks about like
like us, Canada, Europe, European countries, Western Europe. So it's talking about like this part of the world. Okay, so.
And he's interested in understanding how like the technology is changing.
So now we have much more surveillance. Many more certain may many more types of surveillance technologies. So we have all sorts of technologies gathering data from us, and he wants to know how this you know. The transformation of technologies
is changing like the policies around privacy. So it's it's a very simple idea. We have changing technology. How does that change technology influence? You know the policies around privacy. It's very, very, you know. He could have said that like in in one paragraph.
Okay, so. And look one thing that he says, and I I personally agree with him. We, when we are in school people, teach us that policy is something that you know any kind, any piece of policy.
It's very rational, and we tend to perceive policies as rational. When we think about Covid policies, we strongly believe that they were very well thought
right. So. And then, when we go through Covid, we we realize oh, my gosh! Those people who make the policies are being stupid, or what right like, you know, like some policy. Don't make sense, you know, or they contradict each other, or you know, I remember. And now it's all not fresh in my mind anymore. But during Covid here in Canada, like you know, those policies. They don't make any sense like some of them. I was like complaining about the policies I was following them, but I was complaining about them, and saying that that doesn't make any sense. I am an immigrant in Canada. I can. I could name to you like me.
No like. I'll share with you right now. I got my
permanent residents in Canada, meaning that now I am a permanent resident of the country, and I am waiting for them to send my my card because of, like, you know, like when you are a resident of the country, you got a card that you know there's an identity. And look at this. The policy says that you know that that
I have to wait for my card, and I cannot leave the country.
So let's suppose I have a business meeting in the United States. I cannot leave. I cannot go, so. The policy, like you know, interf. And because in in Canada there's like, you know, if you guys know about passports and everything, there's huge delays for passports for any kind of Id you know, like or most kinds of, Id like passport being one. So for you guys, if you're a Canadian, you're gonna get a passport. It's gonna take you 6 months. I don't know it's even more and
and the same for my card. It's gonna take 6 months to arrive, so it's like.
and I cannot leave the country. I mean, this is an absurd. Let's suppose that someone in my family dies right so, and I have to go back. I mean you get you get the points I'm just giving you. We don't you think of policy as something very oh, no, i'm sure that there is some rationality. No, Bs: I mean surprise surprise. Nothing works right like. So I mean, yeah, we could talk about policy, you know. But the same, the same goes for privacy policies, I mean. They look so good on paper. In their reality. They don't quite work, you know, so that's kind of get ready for
for that. So look one more thing here, people. So, Paul: okay. So, Paul. Oh, my gosh, they are not rational. Yes, they are not, you know, and we tend to think that they work so and and look. They are very contact. They are. They are impacted. Policies are influenced by like
context, specific constraints. In my case me waiting for my Id card, you know, like I I actually emailed the government, and I got a reply today, and they told me. Oh, i'm so sorry. No about you whatever, you know. But you know there's nothing we can do. You have to wait. It's just because we don't have enough menpower for like for crisis. Just hire more people and print those cards quicker. But anyways, whatever there's some constraints in there right like like styles like government government governing styles. I mean this style.
you know. Who Whoever is running the bureaucracy also.
like policies, are very much influenced by by the legacy within the bureaucracy, like, you know, like which it's kind of a little bit of style. True, it's mixed with style, not quite style, but, like you know, things have always been done that way, and then, therefore, they keep doing things in that way. I mean again.
just to talk about passport, I mean. Canada could very easily just bring more passports, and you know, and get all the Canadians outside of the like. You know people are lining up for for months. I mean that's an absurd. But again, you know. Oh, we have. We have always done that way. So we're gonna keep doing that way and politics I mean a lot of the policies they have to with politics. I I shared with you guys that i'm doing research in prison right now, and I can't. I could. I could stay here. They could talk the whole day about policies
that you know that they look very nice on paper, but in reality they don't work. So, For example, i'll give you just one example the solitary confinement policy. Now we have a new policy in Canada that we have a you know we we Don't have solitary confinement anymore. What we have is like, it's like we confine deep in a specific area, and they can. It's not really solitary anymore. Anyways, I won't give you what today is but like. But the point is
when they made that policy they forgot that about 30 of the people who who go to solitary in Canada, you know, like people who are in prison, and then they are transferred to solitary. They are people
who actually, they ask to go because they are receiving threats
in the main population. So let's suppose you are a prisoner. You owe some money. Someone wants to kill you because you have a debt. So you go to a correctional officer and say, Look, I want to please, just like I. I am in danger. There's risks. Just put me away for a few days until things they
chew out, and then I can come back. So 30 30% of all the people who go to solitary. It's just this kind of situation, and the policy now is that in a way that people inside of the solitary they mixed up.
So so if I get this person, and I put this person solitaire for their own protection. They might be mixing up with another image in there that actually friends with the guy who you know who who he owes money to, and that guy could stab him so it's like, i'm just give you an example like you know people make policies. They don't understand their reality, and you know, and and things just backfire very, very badly. But they look amazing on paper, because, look, oh, you know the new polls. It says that Canada no longer has
solitary confinement. Isn't that beautiful. It is beautiful on paper, but in reality people are getting killed. So you you right? So, anyways look back to privacy here. Why, you know
why you know why this offer Bennett is interested in exploring policy changes
in regards to technology, because obviously there is massive amount of surveillance happening right now. There is massive amount of of personally identifiable information being gathered from us all the time. There is a huge advance advance advancement in media social media. So it's like it's just huge right? So so that's that's pretty much the point, so he wants to understand.
Is this changing the the
policy landscaping
landscape? It is okay. So look i'll get you the chat in a second.
But we we, we have it. We have one, or we have quite a few minutes. Okay. So look.
The point is here we do have before we talk about the policies, and I would like to highlight some policies for you.
I would like to for you to keep in mind. There is a paradigm paradigm this word in English and use model. There is a framework. There is a paradigm for the governance of privacy. When you think about how we society should govern privacy.
Oh, I just saw that knowledge is and spelled here. But, like you, got to think about 2 things, 2 principles. The first one is knowledge.
So when we're going to govern people's privacy.
we need
to do it in a way that that
people are aware they are knowledgeable about their data, and they are knowledgeable. They have the knowledge that their data is being collected. So it's almost like this: the framework that we have. Now it. It's based on those those 2 assumptions.
One is that we need to form people and take note of that 2 assumptions. Okay. The the paradigm for governance in today's world is based on the assumption that we need to tell people. Look, your data is being gathered.
So you need to know this, and that's why, when you do anything on Internet, they are or anything anywhere, they any kind of service they ask you, do you consent? And quite often we don't read right like those small letters about the consent part, and we just say, yes, we just tick the box, and and that's a problem, by the way, right like in in, in in firms and enterprise corporations. They take advantage of that. They know that we don't read, and they take advantage, and they put stuff in there that later.
you know, we can't avoid right. So.
And the idea of consent so so that we have to consent to give up, give out our data. So those 2, those 2 ideas, knowledge and consent. And please fix. I'm going to fix on this slide. This is spelling here.
is it? No, it's right. I think it's right. Yeah. Knowledge. Yeah, it's right. So like, you know. So those 2 ideas, it's really important. So all the entire in most Western countries. The governance of privacy is based on those 2 assumptions, knowledge and consent. Okay, that doesn't make any good, because I mean, sometimes again, people just like you know that you
you don't really have the knowledge, or you know you just tick the box right? So
so, people, when we think about the governance of privacy we have to think about. We talked about the assumption, the driving assumption. And now we're going to think about the agencies and actors issuing legislation.
So we have a bunch of legislation around privacy. So, and we have actors and agencies. It's usually government that issues that legislation. And then so we, if you're going to steady privacy and privacy law. You have to be mindful of that. Okay, who is the agency here? Right? So. And then also you you got to think about like not only the legislation, but you gotta think about the agencies and actors is showing this standard
standards, because, look you have a legislation. The legislation says Marcella needs you can only Co. You can only collect, you know, you know, identify, identify the information from our Sal. If she is with that. Okay, great.
But you need a standard. How do you know if I agree or I do not agree?
So you you know we need to create standards. And in, for example, that little
tick box that we sign. That's the standard, I mean, and and it's. But it's not by chance that you know those consent agreements. They look the same in every kind of service that we get, because there is some standards behind that right so overall. But those standards. They don't work. Yeah, I agree. But but you know, but that's we need to fix them.
We also need about. We also need to think about the authorities enforcing enforcing the legislation and standards. It's almost like the same way that we have the police to, you know, to reinforce things. We need some sort of privacy police that enforces, you know, like you know, the legislation and the standards, because there's no good if you have laws, but nobody follows the law, and nothing happens to people who break the law. Right? So so that's why. But and I can tell you right now that
the last boxing here the authorities in forcing legislation.
We it's. This is like it's like
we are not we a society? We are not doing a good job in there. Okay.
another thing that we let's. Let's just case now. We know those 3 things that we got to think about. You know the legislation, the standards and the enforcement. But before, let me just go in the chat here so I can see you guys.
So we talked about this in community service like, yeah, okay, yeah, how people often in power do not understand or have experience exactly people because look, Lucy, you are so right. I mean, look at the language. Think about the standards that we like those
like agreements that we sign, especially like with, like, you know, like service over the Internet, that there's nobody there to explain to us what that means.
and and you know it's the we we. If we don't check the box, we the the page, cannot move ahead, and Sometimes we are in a hurry because we're gonna buy something, and we just like, skip that part right? We just say check and go, and so, but that I mean, you know. I mean, if you are the more education you have.
you know, and usually education is a is is to your socioeconomic status to your parents and everything I mean, the more education you have, the more you're going to take the time to actually read that stuff, or the more education you have. You're going to have the ability to scheme read. You're going to read Super fast.
you're gonna, you know. So for you, who have a lot of location who go to the U. Of a, who had parents who had, you know, like degrees, and the parents went to the University, and you, who had, like, you know, all sorts of resource for you is going to be much easier, you know, to kind of navigate that landscape. But if someone who, you know.
who doesn't really know. It's kind of, you know, functional like the the person it's almost like literate, I mean, like like, technically speaking, the person cannot really comprehend. I mean it's it's much harder, right? So, and that ties back to social economics to schooling. I mean to opportunities in life. So
So your comments really really good, you know
Exactly. You know that's exactly that there is now. Okay. So there's that, that, you you know, like artificial intelligence. That kind of Matthew is talking about here that you know it gives you just the unusual stuff. Yeah, but the thing is that even that, Matthew.
for you to break that language down, I mean, because sometimes we read, we understand. But we don't know what that means, right, so even that the artificial intelligence they might flag stuff to you, but might not, you know, but again requires you having some knowledge of this subject matter.
Yeah, exactly. And and Anita, i'm not surprised to hear that, because again, just like I told you guys, this the forcing side is just awful.
We don't really have any kind of enforcement. Let's suppose that you know that your data was sold.
I mean what you're gonna do. Do you have the money to access the justice system to to file a lawsuit. How much that's gonna cost you? I don't. I don't have the money If I know that you know that I mean my data is somewhere. I'm, i'm, I'm done lost. I'm gonna. Of course I will try to use all the resources, but very likely I won't have the money to access the the justice system.
you know. So that means in the end. I'm going to be, you know.
I mean travel right like i'm screwed to
to to try to use. You know what cursing. So
yeah, exactly, Jessica. You're very right, you know.
Yeah. So look here, people. So I would like you to keep this, I mean, do do you have to memorize that? No, you do not. But i'd like you to know. I mean, you're not gonna ask the specific thing in a specific thing like this in the exam. But i'd like you to know
that those agencies that you see in front of you here they cancel of Europe.
O, we Cg: EU: okay.
Like the Apec Asian Pacific Corpor Corporation, the Wto: Those are the biggest agencies issuing privacy loss.
Okay.
So and I. Why do I have this little mark on the European Union? Because the European Union has this
huge body of legislation called general data protection regulation? That is the most advanced.
They data protection legislation in the world. Canada now is trying to catch up with Europe and Canada is trying to mimic what's happening in Europe. We're going to talk about that. But the point is why Canada wants to get on board with whatever is happening in Europe. First, because there is social movements, human rights, movements pressurize in Canada to do that in the internal movements. Second, because if Canada has the same kind of template legislation as
Europe. It's easier for business because think about business in today world.
Of course, a lot of it is like
like pro, like a products like things that we buy
and import, but a lot of the business into the world into this world. It has to be like, you know, research and development. It has to do with, like, you know, knowledge being transferred, I mean, you know, consulting companies. So like, if you have that kind of, or or data being sold and being exchanged. So you know. So if you have that agreement, if if your country has the same template as 0
and Europe being the most advanced legislation. It's easier for your country to make business with Europe. That's that's the whole drive behind it's money, people, you know. So I also like to say to you that courts
like like for it in Canada, in European countries and elsewhere. They also play a major role in regulating privacy. Okay, so i'll give you one example here that comes from Spain. So in Spain 2,014 Google lost
a lawsuit to a guy.
this guy like this guy he had a building.
He had the building that had some that okay, and I can't remember exactly the details of the store, because I never read the court case I I did. I follow that on the media. But this guy, you know he had the building and the building had that, and then the the the building what went on a forced kind of auction
like the Government force the guy to sell the building so the Government could, you know, get paid back which normal, normal kind of circumstance that happens all the time every day in every country but this guy. So this the problem was every time. That's someone who type his name. This guy's name on the Internet immediately
that, like you know what you'd find was not his Facebook page or his linketing. It would be this like building story like this story about the building and the option and blah blah blah. So he he filed a a a suit against Google, you know, and requesting Google to remove. That's like that. That that search, you know. Take that away from that information from search, because he was saying, come on. You know
that doesn't make any sense. That part of my life is solved. The building is not even here anymore, you know, I mean. But like. You know, the first thing that people hear about me is this bad story right? So so he actually won his court case, and that court case became very, very famous.
It's the right to be forgotten. I'm sure some of you might have heard about that. Have you ever heard about this right to be forgotten
that you actually have the yeah. So some of you yeah. So people, just for your knowledge, you actually do have the right.
you know, to request. You know, any kind of search engine, including Google, to remove information from you information that is inadequate information that is irrelevant, or that it's no longer relevant, you know, because too much time has passed.
So so we all we have this, you know, thanks to you know. And after losing this court case, Google created, you know, like
a channel for you to actually report. You know something that you want to be taken away from the Internet. I've seen news article about people complain that that that doesn't quite work again. It goes back to
Enforcement. There is nobody forcing that right so but but anyways, but that I mean, this is just an example of how court cases they actually they actually advance the legislation in regard to privacy.
Okay, another topic here. Let's see how much time I have. Okay, 5 min Look, we talked about here, so we are dissecting those 3, or, if not by dissecting. But I kind of go going over. So you understand where we're coming from. So let's talk about the standards now. So in terms of standards again.
just to say, oh, you have the right to be forgotten. That's not enough. We actually need a protocol. We need a standard for that to happen right? So I mean for sure, Google my having there some sort of standard
that you know that internal standard. You know that they follow, however, those standards there, not only for internal things. They are for societal things, too. So we need standard. So
who are the organizations is showing standards for a, for for, for for for for for for for, for, for for for for for for the regulation of privacy. It is the I. S. O.
I saw also known as Iso.
Probably if I have, I don't know if I have anybody here in sciences but people in sciences you might have heard of I so 9,000, I so 2,000, I so 8,000. Those are standards, for you know they have like quality assurance standards, I mean, I so produce a lot of standards for quality assurance.
European Committee for a standard standardization, European Telecommunications Standards Institute Institute of Electrical Electronics, Engineers standards, I mean. So I mean, this is like, just so, you have an idea. But how about Canada? We are just starting people. We are really behind, really, really behind. Okay.
Another thing that I would like to to talk to you on those 3 is like the idea of all like whoever is doing this enforcement here right like the enforcement part. So you, when when you're gonna study privacy laws. You gotta think about that. So
we actually call the people enforcing. We call them data protection forages. So it's like Dpa. So we need to think of. Who is the Dpa? Is there a Dpa? Because if there is a Dpa, if there is no Dpa, nobody is gonna actually, you know, respect. Right? So so what kind of role do they play? They are kind of on woodsman.
They are kind of auditors there. They play the role of consultant educators a lot of their their jobs. Education is to tell us our rights right? So
negotiate policies and device policies enforce laws in Canada in the Federal level. The office of the Privacy Commissioner is the Dpa.
In the provincial level in each province we have one kind of Dpa in Alberta is the office of the Information Privacy Commissioner. Okay. So just you. You have an idea, because I want you to think about this structure. To think about privacy and privacy. Loss is to think about the legislation.
Who Whoever is, is showing that legislation to think about the standards and to think about the Pdas, which is the authority forcing. So I want you to keep this in mind. If you ever decide to do a capstone and honors, These is where a masters, or if you ever decide to take like, you know, kind of this business of privacy more seriously like meaning, take it to grad school or to research, or if you're gonna work with that, you need to kind of have this in your mind. Okay.
let's see here. Oh, I have one more minutes. So i'm going to stop you here, people.
and here those are the pages that i'd like you to kind of
focus on for the exam.
you know, because I I know that the whole the art was really dry, you know. But you know, and then I I I will finish my lecture. I'm gonna pre record a lecture for you, and then i'm gonna actually cover. You know the legislation in Canada, and then we can talk about that later. I also will try to do my pre record pre recorded lecture. I'll go back to a few slides from last class that I wanna highlight for you.
I think that's that's it for today, because my time is up. I'm sorry, people. I was a little bit in a hurry here, but stay on the line if you have questions, or if you want to share anything, or if you have any concerns or anything for now, thank you very much. You guys have a great afternoon. Take care of yourselves, your physical and mental health. Okay.
take care of you and that oh, and I have off hours if you need me today. So
Thank you. People take care. Okay.
Hello.
I mean, just let me just stop the recording thing here. So I don't want to record your question. So.
"
Feb 2

"Hello, everybody, Welcome back!
Just give me a second. Let me get the lights on
so you guys can see me. Well, well, it's a bit better. So hello, everybody! I am talking to you guys from Vancouver, As I told you today's class is gonna be pre recorded. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna finish? Yeah, like the Tuesday's class
after i'm gonna go back to the class that we had in January 26,
because some slides I kind of. When I was passing them I skipped them. So we're gonna go back in there and then we're gonna move to the topic. The actual topic of today. Okay.
before I continue, I would like to let you know. Well, let me just get my timer.
You're running. I'd like to let you know that I reset
our mock exam on it class because some some of you were telling me that you could not see. You know you could not see like the the the the thing was not requesting your camera, your mic.
and the the setup that I have you are supposed to show your Id You're supposed to have your camera on it's like full surveillance kind of kind of like environment for the exam. So i'd like you please. Just going there, take those 6 questions again.
Just so you you know you kind of get familiar. Familiarize yourself with the technology.
Okay. So go. When you go to a class go to look for something called Sam S. E. M. Okay.
And if click in there and then you, you're gonna have some instructions from there.
Okay, people, let me just share my slide.
See? Which one is this: this this this one here?
Okay. So let me just share my slide, and then we're gonna pick it up from where I left.
Okay, here we go.
So this is last class like Tuesday's slide. Okay. So this is not like today's slide yet.
So look
we have here. We talked about privacy. We keep talking about privacy, because, you know, we discussed like privacy changes privacy. You know we discuss. We talked about the social aspect of privacy, and then we move to this. You know, we we watch that video about why privacy matters.
Right? So we discuss that, Ted Talk. I won't go back to that. And then we were discussing Bennett's article, which, by the way, if he's from Victoria University just nearby here, right like. Well, you know, like you have to take this ferry.
But so he's from Victoria University here in in in British Columbia. Okay, so we were talking about the governance of privacy, how we manage personally identifiable information
in Canada. This article, which kind of be kind of not very easy to read. It talks broadly right, but, like the the high points are, you have to keep in mind that that you know that the way that we manage privacy changes because the concept of privacy changes. I talked about this I won't. I won't. Go back too much into it. You've got to remember the policies regardless if it's about immigration, if it's about corrections, if it's about whatever we tend to think, and we are taught that privacy, that law, that policies
are very, very rational, but they are not. So you're going to see a lot of irrationality in in in policies. And
And then here's some context of why, you know, to think about. The governance of privacy is important. I cover that. And then I told you that the whole paradigm paradigm means model framework. The framework for us in today's society to govern. Privacy is up. It's based on knowledge and consent.
So you can't. You have to tell people? Look, I am going to collect your information. Do you agree?
And in a lot of the cases the kind of the the idea of consent is kind of almost like forceful right? Because we can't say no, because if we say no, we don't really get the service right like, but anyways, but at least there is this valuing there somewhere. However, we could be critical here, not in the 200 level course, but we could criticize the those 2 values. Okay, because
you know, it's not quite like that. Looks good on paper, but that's not exactly how it happens. And then I told you for you, if you want to do your caps on your honors. If you're in a study grad school, whatever you're going to go to law school, you want to study
privacy. You gotta think about the agencies and actors issuing the legislation. So you think about the legislation you think about the standards.
and whoever is enforcing. And I told you that you know Enforcement is a problem, and even like the standards are a problem. I went yesterday morning I went to the to Canada place in Edmonton
to get my new SIM card. I told you guys, that i'm trying I'm i'm moving from temporary to lend that immigrants. So I had to get a new card, and and then I had to go in and get a new same card, see number.
and then, like you know, I I gave them my information right. I gave them my birth. They gave them my they already had, but I had to fill out the forums again, and and they gave me a little sheet to read
about like. Oh, you know you are sharing this information with the Government. This is what we're gonna do with your information. We're going to share with, you know, within the government of Alberta, and also we may share that with the well. This is Federal government. So we're going to share that within the Federal Government
and again. And so the guy working at the scene like the the Eds, whatever forgotten all the the employment and development, whatever office, he told he told me. You know, ma'am, do you mind? You know he had this like little like, you know, like thing with the you know, was like on the on his desk.
So he's like, you know. Do you mind? Just could you please just to read this thing, I mean. And then I read, I mean, I could. I could understand, especially because I teach on that top it no problem. But I mean a lot of people they would say why you're even doing that. I mean, I don't. I can't. I don't understand. I can't make sense of that. And the standard was kind of
I notice, because I mean, we're discussing this thing I should have. I should have photographed that for you.
But what I notice is like, you know it's like the language was very unclear. They could improve their English in there and make more plan clear for people, you know, especially like a lot of canada You have to remember 25 of the the the countries immigrants overall. Are you saying that immigrants? They cannot read no they can, but it's just like the way that you say things sometimes. It's just like you know. It's unclear, and even like Canadians, they can. So you know you have to think about the client who's going to read this thing, and and not necessarily. Everybody has a, you know, post, secondary degree, and and
and etc., etc. So but I thought about you because there was the standard that they were using, like, you know, some sort of like, you know.
a template that you were using. And and again.
there is not really, I mean, we have the we. We have, the Commissioner or the Privacy Commissioner Office in in Alberta, and we have the Federal as well as well. But I mean but people don't really, you know, we don't have any kind of entity or agency kind of
you know, making sure that those standards, those templates that they are using. They they are actually good, right? So I told you all of those things. So again you think about privacy. You gotta think about those 3 dimensions. So 3 aspects: okay, legislation standards and enforcing enforcement. Okay.
So we talked about those organizations here. I talked about the right to be forgotten, so we'll go back. I told you about those other organizations here in front of you, about the standards, I mean.
and then, you know, we talked about the the data protection authorities that they are supposed to enforce and make sure that you know organizations. They are doing what they are supposed to do when it comes to informing people that in in obtaining consent of people, you know, for for you know, when it comes to, you know, personally identifiable information. Right? So anyways, this is all covered
in last class, so you can go and watch the video.
And then here I told you that I mean. Now in Canada we have this big not only in Canada, everywhere in the world, but also in Canada. We have this big shift
like transformation. That's why I have those leaves a transformation in how we, you know, in in our legislation, like the privacy legislation. So the trend that we have happening in Canada and elsewhere is more accountability.
Like
to be more ethical about how we obtain consent, how we give consent, and all those things.
you know we are also, you know, we we are like the understanding now, like the you know, the way that we are governing privacy is based on on, on, you know, like the the whole legislation is kind of built on the idea that we have risks
that harm can be done if, like the information is leaked.
and also that people have the right to privacy. So this is kind of it's getting those 3, you know, risk harm, and rights. It's getting. It's getting more.
you know, kind of getting more embedded in the legislation. So so we see, even in Canada here of the huge transformation. And also there is the recognition that privacy is a social value.
Privacy has always been a social value, but now the lawmakers, they they are more mindful and aware of that, and trying to kind of, you know.
kind of make that a reality. Okay, on the ground.
Okay. So now let's talk about privacy legislation in Canada, and I have that beautiful picture for you, because this is my Canada. When I think about Canada. That's the image that I get. You know I love hiking. So that's what it comes to mind. So privacy, legislation in Canada.
So look
here, it's just a quick timeline for you. Just so I can put it in
you. Well, I I said, it's Canada, but I want to give you a some broader perspective. So just so, you know. I mean I was born in 1980.
You guys were born, probably in the 2,000 late 19 nineties, you know, or sometimes even mid 2,000.
But look, the first data protection law
actually came from Germany in 1,970,
and in after that, very early on 1970, Germany. Okay, and later in 1974. I wasn't born yet. We had the watergate scandal in the United States. I don't know if you ever studied that in school.
But what happened there was that the Conservative people like to supporters of the Conservative party.
They stormed just like they, you know people stormed Congress in the United States, like, you know, in January last year they stormed the National headquarters of the Liberal party, the the Democratic party in in in the Us. You know. So
so and then, like in in in in Nixon at the time, was the President of the United States, You know. He went through a great deal of work to try to hide that he had people from his party that he knew about it, I mean, you know, like. And then that was the watergate scandal. So after that.
like, you know, the United States starts to think about, You know they start to think about, you know, like privacy, and that they needed privacy laws that they need to regulate information that you know Presidents. They couldn't just hide information, and that I don't know if you are watching the they need the media for following the media right now. But there's a a huge deal happening in the United States with regards to like the the storage of classified information. So Trump was caught
like misplacing classified information a while back, and then Df. B. I got involved. Now it is Biden who got caught
in the same situation, so like they found, you know, classified documents in in in Delaware, I mean, a biden is from Delaware. It's a state in the United States, I mean, and that's where his base is, and he has
apparently more than one home in there, and and they caught, you know, like that, you know, like classified stuff like in his garage and classified stuff, and you know, anyway, else elsewhere in his home and now and he but the the the only thing is that I mean he's he's, he's he's saying that he's complying with the FBI. So you know. But anyways like same situation again. So so that, and why this is a big deal, because their their laws in place that says, Look, you can't just misplace information like that especially classified information and blah blah blah blah! Right?
So so this is all context for you. So Germany, 1,970, and then watergate 1,974. So essentially it comes from crisis right like this. Those the need for legislation usually comes from crisis
or some big social movements
for Canada here in 1983. I was 3 years old, so 83, the Government, the government of Canada a passed or approved
enacted. That's the the actual term approved the the Privacy Act. Okay, and that was our first privacy legislation, and that applied only for Federal Government institutions. So that had no jurisdiction
over the sun is in my face. Here, let's see if I can prove that. Okay. And that had no jurisdiction over the provinces in Canada. It's only the State. Okay, the Federal State, the Federal Government.
and then a couple of a decade. 10 years later.
Quebec.
Quebec people in Canada is one of the most advanced provinces in terms of privacy, legislation. So Quebec introduce the first privacy, a private sector.
private, the first private sector privacy law. Okay. So because until then, I mean all the like, even like the water gate. I mean the you know the American Privacy Act and all those things they they were.
you know they were for Federal employees and Federal businesses and Federal government and Federal affairs, but did not cover like private. So so it was Quebec actually, that extended that to private business and private people and privacy in private. You know the private sphere of society
in 1,994 and 95 like. We had the the freedom of the for what we call VoIP freedom of information, protection, and of privacy. Act in Alberta.
So you can come us. I mean we played a very important role, too. And but what's nice about me? Not nice, but what what you should remember about the like any kind of what you should know about vip legislation. Okay, like any kind of freedom of Information and Protection Privacy Act is that it tries to strike a balance between.
You know, the right to know.
and the right to privacy, because again.
everybody is entitled to privacy. But certain things you need to know right. So there's a you have to find a balancing there. It's almost like Think about sex offenders, I mean.
There's a whole debate, I mean in Canada, you you know you like the communities they have the right to know.
So every time that corrections release someone who is a sex offender into the community they publish in the newspaper. Oh, so and so is being released, and you know, and we live in this location, and we'll be, or they don't say the location where the person we live. But they say, you know, this person is going to be in the community. And why? Because I mean, yeah, that person, even though it's a former image. That person has a right to privacy. It's a citizen right so, and and but you know the population. The community also has the right to know, sir.
So so you know. So
what what VoIP legislation does, and all of all of the
extent, all the
patient, just some extent. They try to.
That's what you need to know. And
so so yesterday, when I was at the Yes DC.
Like the guy gave me, I should have capped. I thought I actually threw away. That was a mistake. I should have kept
through a booklet.
How like how I can be careful about my information, because, you know, there's a lot of fraud and scams involving the same card, same number.
So he gave me this manual of like, You know
that that people may ask my scene number, but i'm not.
You know i'm not obliged. I'm not like I don't have to give. So, for example, he was telling me he was walking me through that document right? It. It's part of the procedures part of the standard you have to all.
So he was like. Oh, you know, if the landlord asks for your sinker. You don't have to give it. If you're gonna do some, you know shopping, whatever like you're gonna buy a car. You're gonna take a loan or something you don't have to give. And then he was like, okay, if people is
your sink card you have to tell them. Why do you want? And then there's even like that. He gave me a telephone number. You know what next? I'll have to.
I don't know if I have to. But you know, if I if I come, if I if I ever go to Canada Place again like before leaving Admin, i'm gonna pick up another book like, you know, because it's nice having that, you know, especially for this class.
But anyways.
so a little bit more here, so in Canada, 2,001 we had. We had a very important piece of legislation. It's called, probably some of you you heard about this.
This is this is this is.
Oh, Federal. No.
yeah, yeah, that's it. So it's like, you know, it's like it involves the private sector, but it involves also a Federal business. Okay, so. So the the thing is with people that is that you know it. It. You know it like.
for example, if if if some private like Sector Company had dealings with the the the Federal Government that would involve them. But it was still mainly for the prior, for the Federal Government. You know the affairs. I mean that all just like the previous ones was like main mainly target targeting Federal government.
So what you should remember about
you know about Pipeda is that it's actually well, this is a I, I I it for you because it's really important. But but you know here in 2,004 is actually like. This is a defencement of people that in 2,004 is even like
It's it's it's something I don't want to say it's more important, because I mean the the the the the beginning of the legislation is more important. However, you know, like in 2,004 people, they start to cover all the private sector. True. Okay.
So, however, a people that had some provinces that they were not included in Alberta was one of them. Initially, you know, later on. I believe that Alberta got involved, too, but not wasn't like, if I remember correct correctly, was like, should be C in Alberta in the very beginning
they did not but like to keep it that did not cover them. And then I think I believe that later Alberta and DC. Got on board with it. Okay, but what what matters is that? I mean, you know it also became private sector. Maybe we also start to cover the private sector, because people think with me
most of the dealings in society Think about. Think about the employment, think about the education, think about like those core activities that you do in your daily life.
It doesn't really involve the private, the the the the public sector. You know there is a lot of your life that is, that happens within the domains of the public sector, like, you know, health, for example.
and all your benefits and all your, you know. But there is a lot of your data. I mean it's being collected by the private sector. Right it? That's when you you know you get a cable, you know for your Internet, for your for your apartment. You get some cable when you
you take a loan from the bank when you you know it's like you. We a lot of our lives is much more in the private sector than in the public sector, although i'm not it doesn't mean that one is more important than the other. But the point is any privacy legislation has to cover.
You know the private sector, and that's when we look back. We just go back in here, and we look back at those timelines that I'm. Giving you.
What we see is the history of pro private legis, privacy, legislation covering. You know also the the the private sector. Okay. So for people that it happened in 2,004. Okay.
Now, okay, we have Bill 64 in Quebec. I don't know if you heard about it. Probably not because it's just for Quebec.
But again, Quebec is taking the lead right so. And this bill here. It's in crazy. What what does it do? And i'm kind of I I analyze. And I gave you the 5 main things that this new bill that covers privacy what it does. It increases pay not for non-compliance, and that's huge
that it speaks to this thing here that we were talking earlier.
I mean it. You know the last box like like forcing, because what is the good? If you have all this legislation, if you have all those standards and nobody's complying with them, and there's no there's no authority like, you know, like keeping everybody in check, so that's huge. So so back now came with this new, you know, like Bill, and it's gonna increase the the penalty. And
honestly, if a business gathers your information, and they, you know, and they don't, really, you know, follow the procedures, and and they don't do it for the right reasons. I mean the reasons that are in the law. I mean they can go bankrupt with the cause. It's like
like Quebec is applying huge fines, so it's really it's like every business in Quebec. Right now. They're getting on board of that, and they're, you know, making sure. So if you travel to Quebec next time, probably going there, you're gonna see many more kind of all, you know. Do you give your consent? Sign here? Kind of situation? Right? So another thing here
the right of action against offenders.
you know, like this. It's almost like the statue of limitation of the law.
is is increase has been increased. So so if someone does something wrong, any company that's collecting like leaks, information, or sales information that they're not supposed to or or do something that they're not supposed to. You know the timeframe for people to prosecute those companies, or and including for the State
to prosecute in case it's criminal, you know it increased from 3 to 5 years.
I believe it should be even bigger, like the the limit, like the limitations should be longer should be more time, because, you know, I mean the damage that you know that you can make in someone's lives is just huge.
but but anyways, and sometimes it takes time for you even to learn that your information was leaked. It. It takes time for that fraud to happen. You know what I mean like, so it should be more years, but anyways, but it it's moving from 3 to 5. So now you have, like, you know, 5 years to take actions against offenders.
You also like it. The new legislation it makes like mandatory for companies to report breach, break like any any bridge, so which you know in many cases the companies they try. Oh, shh! Don't tell anybody. Don't say, you know just
but that now, if they do that, I mean it's tribal fines, and sometimes criminal prosecution, even depending on the situation.
And now and also like like that's something number 4. It's something that some people are complaining a little bit, but, like you know, the legislation in Quebec it kind of it had some some exempt. So there. There are instances where you don't really need to ask for people's consent.
you know. So, for example, I, you know flower delivery. Let's suppose you buy some flowers from me, and you ask me to deliver those from the those flowers, so obviously obviously for me to deliver the flower for you. You need to give me an address, so I mean, I don't need to do paper work for that, because I mean otherwise. The you know the business cannot happen right like this is like
inherent to the business. However, there is the need to protect that that address. It cannot be leaked. I cannot use that address to, you know, to storm with the advertisement, you know, like their their rules around, but anyways, like you know, they, they. They are like a situations exempt to consent.
and they kind of they. Now there is more situations, instances where you can have an exemption, and some people, you know, some privacy advocators. They are complaining, and I understand where they're coming from, but essentially, but they but also they are not kind of making it
open wide. No, this just like very specific there. So there is this like on the flip side. You know the the exempt. It's very, very well defined, so it's like when you know.
For example, if you need to assess this is the the the potentiality of a fraud, or if you need to do some security assessment, then you can. You know you can. You don't need to, you know, to
demand people's consent because you are actually trying to protect them, you know. And also you know, if the if the information is necessary for the service, just like the flower example that I gave you, and also the legislation came back, is the the whole goal.
It is like it. It's almost like there's this kind of model, this kind of slogan that is privacy by design. So firms, you know, providing technologies. They must have privacy built in in their products. So if you're going to create, let's say you and your classmates are going to make an app.
you know, just like for dog Walkers, I mean, you know you're gonna make an app for something. And then in your app you need to. But in features that will, you know, ensure people's privacy. So that's what privacy by design means. Okay.
so
one more piece of legislation. So again do you have to memorize this for the exam. No. What you need to memorize is the trends so like this trend that you know increasingly like the legislation, is covering the private sector, and like the Trans. Here. What I am here is like, you know the the those 2 5 items, those 5 items. They can be very specific, but they can be transcribed into trends too, like, you know, more penalties, like more compliance, more enforcement.
you know, like more action against offenders. You know this i'd like you to. I would like you to know that I mean You don't need to know the the actual words. What you need to know is what, what? What are the trends? You know here that what people have to do now, which that's what I just explained right so.
And in Canada we have Bill c. 27. I don't know if you heard about that bill.
but it is if this bill was stabled
in December early December last year.
and what that that means. It means that it was sent to the Parliament, so they can vote. They can analyze and vote the bill. So this is called it, has a long name, an act.
It's called Consumer Privacy Protection Act.
and it has actually a triple name, consumer, privacy, Protection Act.
Person, the the the person, person information and data protection, right, Buno Act and Artificial Intelligence and Data Act. So it's actually this legitimate Bill Bill c. 27 is actually 3 like it's 3 acts. It's like 3
bodies of legislation. So it's like, you know. So it's not just one legislation like 3. Okay, so and and this is people.
This is the the most. I mean it, Hasn't. It's it's not enacted yet. Meaning it's not valid, yet it's not Ha! But it's under assessment right now, right so in in my come this year. So this bill is extremely important, and I even have that star for you in there. Why?
Because it brings Canada very close to that legislation that I talked about last class, like the European Union legislation.
and that will facilitate business between Canada and Europe and all the you, the countries that they are in the you. Okay, so. And let's let's talk a little bit about that. So
because it is 3 pieces of legislation, so one about consumer privacy, another one about to try Buno and another one about in artificial intelligence. So you're going to break that down to 3. That's why I have 3 by the points for you.
So Cp. Cpa is the Consumer Privacy Protection Act. So what does it do?
What it's doing is, it's gonna solidify the consent regime. The this idea that you absolutely need to see people consent, you know.
before you get their data
there will be exemptions. However, the exemptions are very, very, very well defined, because again, if you put broad exemptions in there, people just you know, they take advantage of that, and they demand more information for you. And no, in that case here it's very well defined exemptions.
It's more accountability.
meaning what meaning that we're gonna have, you know, a privacy management program? Pmp. Stands for privacy management program, or oh, I'd even put for you in there privacy, management management programs so like meaning that I mean the companies.
you know, like they're gonna have. They're gonna need some sort of privacy in the same way that we have quality assurance programs, quality management programs like, you know, we have, like all sorts of programs in place to make sure that, for example, they have.
they have to the teaching evaluation to make sure that people actually do their jobs right like they have some teachers that take attendance just to make sure that students are actually in class. So I mean, you know, we're gonna like companies. They're gonna need to have some sort of privacy management program. So that obviously means
especially for small business people means more money, right? Because they're going to have to kind of be more aware. And and they're going to have to educate themselves on the on those legislations, and they're gonna have to make sure that their businesses are not breaching. So if let's suppose you are selling Brad
at the farmers market. You need to be more careful if you're collecting information for your customers, because you know you don't want to breach any of those legislation, especially now that, you know there's more accountability, more enforcement, and now also finds they can even break you right. So and also this this, this this Cpa.
It's gonna have a clear, clear, clear cut definition between I information that is de identified and anonymized because think with me
to anonymize some information like, let's suppose you know I gave you an interview.
and you want to anonymize my interview. What do you do.
you? You know you just change my name right like you. You make it anonymous.
But you know to de identify is is bigger than just anonymize, because
to de identify you need to not only change my name, and in any mention to my name or to my family people. But also you need to make sure that there is nothing there
that
would allow people who read the transcript interview transcript. We would kind of trace back to me, because sometimes you may say, oh, you know I teach at the U. Of a oh, I'm, I taught 2 to 16 in the winter, 2,023. That is easy, because there was just one class or 2 classes. You can narrow down, you know, like, oh, this is Marcella, or this is Hagerty, and then you can narrow down, and then you can, You know, just by virtue of reading the transcript. You can narrow the who that person is so
so so you know, so like the legislation is kind of Say, look, there is a difference here the identification and anonymization. And they're gonna They're gonna delve into that and say, you know there are instances where you're gonna have to de-identified information. There is instances that you're gonna have to anonymize the information. Okay, try Buno
right? Bono is easy. Why do we have a tribunal? Because so people can. Actually, you can make complaints because I mean the criminal justice system in Canada, and also the justice system in Canada, because it doesn't have to be criminal. It's just like the justice system is so expensive for all of us to access.
So now they have tribunal in the same way that they have human rights, right? Bonus. They're gonna have, you know, the the the person, information and data protection data protection. Okay, so this is all about enforcement and compliance, which is very nice, and
and then, when it comes to our like, the third item, our treasure intelligence, which is the other act, is a huge enact in itself. So all the people dealing with artificial intelligence. They're going to have to study this law, and they're going to have to break that into detail, so they can make sure they're complying. But essentially the whole goal here
is that you're gonna create systems
that are auditable.
you know. So that's the whole thing. So okay, Marcel, and we're gonna develop a camera that has a treasure intelligence. And then, you know, just like in China, they're gonna be able to just like where we have them in Canada, too. But you're gonna be able to zoom in
inside of you. Capture your face, and then you're gonna be able to cross, you know, process you and they're gonna know. You know who you are. Okay, great. But you know that system needs accountability. That is not like mismatching people, you know. So you, as a engineer.
as a, as a, as a as a a developer, you need to make sure that your system is built in accordance to that law. Essentially, people. It's gonna cost people like everyone who is working with privacy, developing products for that, like
you know, like all those software companies, they're going to be affected by this company. The by this policy.
you know, be for by view, c. 27. Because again, if they, you know.
if their system doesn't really have accountability, if they don't do the the identification or an optimization property, whatever they can be find. And then now, you know, they can go bankrupt, and in some, in some case they can even be criminally prosecuted. So look.
this bill here is Federal. Okay? So we talked about Quebec, so Quebec always. They always have their own thing going on, and they're very advanced when it comes to privacy loss. But this is this is like Canada. Finally, after so many years, like 40, some years, you know.
creating a very robust kind of privacy legislation.
So privacy activists are happy.
and the companies. They are not so happy because they are going to have to invest some money to comply with the legislation. Okay.
So I it's a ped that we are not here because I know i'm sure you guys would have more questions about. But anyways, we're gonna see each other in person again on Tuesday. So
let me just
stop sharing.
and I'm going to share
before I start today's
lectures.
I want to say a few more things about privacy that's just going here, because there they those things they they they are likely to be on the exam.
I haven't prepared the exam yet, but I think I will put that in there. So I want to give you a heads up.
Okay. So here
this is they slide
that I skipped.
Just see something.
Yeah, you know, when I was because sometimes, like, you know, when I am in my other computer set up. Sometimes I click on the
to
times it goes to if that ever happens. And you
So up 2 slides went by. So
and
okay, here this is what like
I'd like, you guys to go back to this lecture
from January 26,
And remember that privacy actually is a human right?
Okay, it's a human right. But, Marcella, not. Everybody understands privacy the same way you told us about shine, and above
or in Canada. Yeah, true.
But the idea is that whatever is your understanding of privacy, you are, you have the right to privacy, whatever that is. Okay. So it is. Article 12 of the Human Rights Declaration, and I have for you here, and when they talk about privacy, they talking very because precisely it is done.
It was man. It was a document that was produced and meant for the humankind.
So for everybody in the world
which is broad, because then you can. You can. I mean it's a language that can be adjusted to whatever reality.
But you know, but it talks about privacy in the family privacy in the home
privacy of correspondence. Okay, communication. So you know, any links to reputation, right like your privacy has to be your reputation to
right like. And we talked a little bit to remember, I think, was Greer, or someone Greer, or some one of our oh, sorry i'm butchering your name, but one of our classmates. They talk about shaming, and you know, and sometimes it's almost like you know. Privacy having privacy is also a little bit about like, okay, let me. It's almost like protection against shaming or anything right like
so.
And that's why I mean those topics. If you notice those topics here in that slide that I miss, where is it again?
Oh, Jesus! Here
you know some of those topics in here. They appeared in the lecture like family, for example, right? So anyways, I won't go back to that because I think I covered everything else.
But
yeah.
yeah, so that that's the thing that I wanted to to tell you.
Okay.
So let me just stop sharing. And now i'm gonna finally go to today's class, and I am. I have.
Well, it's just 30 min. Okay, we still have quite a bit of time. So
let me just find my
this one.
I miss having you, I mean, I know that even when i'm teaching at home I don't see you guys, but I miss kind of having you on the chat.
So at least I can go. I can. Second check if you you're doing well.
Okay.
hey? Share?
Okay.
So I just get some coffee here.
Hey, folks.
So now we're going to start theorizing surveillance part 2. So we had part one. We talked about 1984. We talked about the brief new world. We talked about full. We talked about the loose right, the coin, the list, the French people.
So here we're going to talk about more contemporary and surprise. Surprise.
We're gonna talk about hegeries like Kevin Hegery, the Professor, who was supposed to teach this course. Who was my mentor? Who? He is, My mentor, and was my supervisor at the UV. And and I love I love the guy to bits. He's really he's a really nice supervisor.
and he's very kind. I mean.
you know, anyways, all good things to talk about him. But like, let's go here. So this piece by him. I I even got his picture here because I like to be people, people, people's pictures so just like, you know. So I got from the U. Of a. So so he is at the U. Of a. So if you are interested in surveillance, I mean, you are lucky enough to have
one of the biggest names in surveillance here at the U. Of a right. So so it's Kevin.
and and he's also the director of the
Criminal Justice Center that we have, and he has a big research on prison as well.
and but anyways, but what matters here is a marriage call that he wrote in 2 in the year of 2,000. Okay, so it's like
20 years ago. So the guy, you know, he was much younger than what you see now, and and probably this piece is his most important article and his most cited article. Okay, it's called the Surveillance. By the way, this is
I cop and paste. Let me just fix this right now. You know
I cop and funny, cause I I copy and paste from the syllables. It might be wrong in the syllabus, or sometimes what happened is like
the databases where we have the journal articles instead of saying surveillance assemblage.
They they write our surveillance assemblage, but it's not quite the same because surveillance, is an objective like, just like you know, beautiful, ugly, tall, you know. Short, I mean it's an objective so like surveillance means those who do surveillance or the act of surveilling, and so surveillance assemblage
is an assemblage that does surveillance right? So
So this is a concept that he created. He developed, and he published on this journal article that you guys will read, called in. It was published in the British Journal of Sociology, which is a big big journal. Okay, so
look
the go.
He, Haggard, is Kevin's goal in this article was to discuss recent dynamics and operations of surveillance.
and he wrote that in the year 2,000. So when he says recent, it's like it is already old 20 some years. Okay, so. And in the article he talks about
he talks about Felix
and Felix. I know the his name is like for English speaker, maybe like, you know, a batari whatever, however, you want to call. But you know, Felix, what what he he was a guy, also friends with full call, friends with the list. They're all friends, you know. They were all teaching at the same school.
and he wrote a lot about space for those of you who are interested in geography, and how geograph intersects with surveillance. Felix Guatafi is a guy to go. He doesn't have a lot of books, but he has a lot of interviews, you know where he explains his ideas and his very smart. So
So Kevin, our Kevin from the U. Of a. You know he uses the and he creates this concept called surveillance, surveillance, assemblage, look, surveillance, assemblage. What is an assemblage. It is a collection of
a collection or gathering of things or people right so like, you know, it's just like, but a bunch of things like you know I don't know for sure. I don't have a bunch of things here, but I do have like, you know, this is an assemblage of pens
right like, you know, a bunch of pains like a collection, so on a sandwich.
And what does this assemblage, this? This assemblage is a surveillance assemblage to the surveillance. Right
so. But
and but what exactly so? Look here is the 2 main ideas under lying underlying the entire text.
that this assemblage abstracts human bodies from their territorial settings.
All of us. We all belong somewhere, right. Like we belong in a family. We belong in a community. We belong in a school we belong at the of a. We belong at this gym. We belong at this, you know Club. Whatever you know, this hockey team we belong somewhere.
and like this assemblage that he's talking about
it Abstract. It takes away. It detaches people from their territorial settings.
Does it actually mean that it takes people physically away. No.
no, not no, it's a bit of 4.
Another thing that it does. It separates human bodies into a series of discrete flows. Okay, so you have one body and then you. It's almost like you guys just like chopping board. You guys.
you know you dies the body into many, many flows.
Okay.
and
it re assembles
like this: surveillance assemblage reassembles those flows of body.
you know, into, you know, into in a in a different location
and into a series of data doubles.
So what are you talking about?
People?
It's what surveillance does to us surveillance. Let's suppose Facebook surveillance all the information or Instagram you guys like that are Instagram we use more often, or or linkedin right? So what it does to you is, you live in Alberta, you know else somewhere in that meeting. It takes you away from that community, takes you away.
It moves you into this platform.
you know, so it like it. You know it abstracts your body from the actual territorial belonging. So it's like you belong nowhere, and all because I take you away.
I don't really take you away. I. I take your information away right. But your information is you. Your information is part of your identity, right like. So it takes you away.
and then
it breaks you into many flows. Of what of information?
And it reassembles so it's all the pulls. You approach the many identities that you have. So on Instagram. You have many identities. You are a father or a sister. You travel, you play, you put you all your photos there. Each photo represents one identity that you have, and and Instagram or Meta the company behind that They know that. So you know they pull you. They pull you into like you know, flows of information and re assemble you
into what? Into a profile.
Marcel, there is no a word profing there. Yeah. Data double. That's what a data double is is a profile
okay in in in Hager this language, so like it profiles you. So it takes you away.
would you? This platform dices, you, recreates your data, rearranges your data, and it profiles you.
and then you don't belong. I mean, of course, you as a person you are somewhere.
but this thing like. It has a lot of consequences, because I mean, you know, this movement that the surveillance assemblage does.
It will alter the advertisements that Meta gives to you.
It will, you know, whatever app shows in your you know, and it will influence whatever even shows in your Google Page or your Youtube Page, or you know, or how your I mean.
you know that has real, I mean, even though, like this whole process, it doesn't look real palpable.
It has real consequences in your life.
So sometimes I I talk to friends about something that I wanna buy, and all of a sudden, you know, this thing appears in my Youtube videos, I mean, you know. So it's like. How is that possible? Because again, I am being d.
you know, like like deep d territorialize, you know, and taking away from the territory I mean, this process is happening to me
right. So
so this I mean both so, Marcel. But what is this? The surveillance surveillance of a assemblage. I mean it's it's kind of a concept that he created to kind of help us think and analyze surveillance.
and that became very, very famous, because
essentially what Hegery does is like. He took the ideas of what he and the loose.
and he kind of made them more kind of palpable to a North American society, more kind of palatable, palpable, easy to understand, you know. And because, you see, I mean, if you read that tax. By blues, I mean I had to break that down for you because and I read that many times.
you know, if you're reading French, it's easier if you're reading English, it doesn't really make quite make sense. So you know that's why I took my time breaking that delus for you.
If you go back to Mys lines. You see how I even like, you know
why? Because it's not obvious, like the the way that is written is encoded. There's a lot of references to many things that people don't necessarily know. I I. The first time that I read I could not make sense of it. I had to kind of okay, what he's talking about here.
So so essentially, that's what Harry does, and he transforms that into this surveillance, the same surveillance assemblage like, the concept.
So let's now break his article. So let's talk about the introduction of this article.
Look at this picture.
You might, if I had. I wish you guys were here. But like, what is this? I mean, you're gonna tell me yourself. It's just people walking around.
Yeah, it is. And this is, by the way by Gustav K. You bought.
and this is in a museum in France, in a museum called Mo Mosaic music. Both say like Dorothea Museum in Paris. Okay, so so this is in there. Why? This matters. This is a very famous
pending.
Hegery does not talk about this spending, but I I use the spending, because you know, I know that, like he does not talk about it. But the people who inspired him.
you know, talk about this picture so.
And this picture here of the someone just like roaming around wonder like wandering around just a going around walking around
like it's the symbol of MoD their energy. You're gonna see where I'm: I'm gonna go with this. So this symbol here in in in French language, is called, and the idea of a a needler or a Romer. Okay? So
okay, why this is like, Well, there's a first of all.
the idea of city. It appeared with the Industrial Revolution. No.
and and and that's when, like in Europe, we start to have like the formation of city. So if, like migrants coming from the rural areas, you know, to settle in the cities, in, in, in the working factories that I mean, the idea of Urban and CD. Has to do with
the Industrial Revolution and the Industrial Revolution has with modernity and the idea of city. It allows for people to walk around in a anonymous way.
right? Because look, think about life in the countryside. I don't know if you ever, if there's anybody here who came from a small city, but, like life in a small seat is like everybody knows you. You are under surveillance all the time, because you cannot do anything, because people will tell you they. Everybody knows you, but life in a big city. Nobody knows you.
So you like you are anonymous. You enjoy you so keen into that diversity. The crowds they conceal you, you know, and there is this kind of individualistic kind of scrutiny that you can scrutinize anyone, and you know and doesn't really matter. You can watch
right. So you just to walk around doing nothing, just watching. Actually, that's my favorite thing to do. When, whenever I go to a big city I came from a small city, but I went to university in a big city, and I have lived in many big cities like Shanghai, being one of them like, and I love it because you walk around You're just watching, right? So it's it's
super plus pleasant. So
so this is the scene of modernity. Okay. So what Haggard is going to say in his leads off. If this idea, that surveillance, as we have today.
or the surveillance assemblage, which is this new surveillance.
it breaks the idea of modernity. It means a root, a rupture in this idea of modernity. So like I know that maybe for you. But we actually care. I mean, I don't know what you mean. This is like. He's making theory sociological theory here, and even political theory here, like, okay.
like he's trying to re-understand what the meaning of modernity, because modernity meant the
And now what there is, she means a rupture of that right? So because we we cannot do that anymore, because there is always a camera watching us.
So look! That's exactly where he goes. He goes like like the idea
photography as as like an art, you know it. It gives people a face it breaks the from there.
So this concept, you know that, you know i'm gonna walk around. Nobody will know who I am.
I mean
in the beginning of the twentieth century, when cameras they start to become popular. Not even I mean they were not that popular. It used to cost a lot of money to take a picture, but like when, when, when, when, like the idea of cameras, they they start to kind of spread, and people start to kind of have them, You know. That meant the end of that modernity.
them alternative that was symbolized by the Flanner. And just if you're curious. The person actually who inspired Hagerty is Walter Benjamin. Okay. So if you Google, Walter Benjamin, you're gonna find this. He's he was a Jewish in Germany. He. He escaped
Germany and he was flying to the. He was a fleeing to the United States, and then on the mountains crossing into Spain. He was assassinated.
Okay, he was caught, or actually, I can't remember any more. If he was assassinated, or he or he was about to be caught by the guards from the Spanish police, and then he killed himself. I can't remember now, but but you know.
but he never made to American a lot of the you know the the the, the the the German professors, you know they they made to America, but not this guy, Walter Benjamin. But Walter Benjamin is the person who actually you came up with this idea that modernity is the see symbolized by the front by this person who is.
you know, who is anonymous? Okay? So, anyways, photograph there's no think about now. Smartphone. It's another whole level of like, you know.
So
see if we're gonna judge by that, you know. And if what they're gonna to you was walking around, and the photograph was, you know, like photography as an art was like, you know, the post modernity. Now, with the amount of surveillance that we have is post post posts. Modernity, right? So.
But anyways massive surveillance represents this rupture with modernity. But they're energy, as we knew since the Industrial Revolution symbolized by this idea of the big city. Right? So
so Hagery people he places surveillance in late modernity. So he doesn't go like post post. He just goes late. Modern energy. Okay, so he says, look
well during the chief and then photography as an art, and then like it starting transition and all surveillance, late modern energy. Okay.
So
here I broke for you the steps.
what the surveillance assemblage does
so
live before the Internet
or any kind of
technology that allows for a massive surveillance or surveillance on a massive scale.
Life was very much territorially attach it. Think about life, your your grandparents. You don't have Internet
cool.
right?
This idea that I am in Vancouver right now, you know, in
like my body is here. But I am teaching you guys there, and you were, God knows where, right like it's right. So
So life used to be very, very territorial.
And then, you know, technology allowed for that for that detachment. And and then technology that is that that includes that that is intersected with.
So so so I what I said at earlier on. I broke it here. Detachment from territorial settings, and then
there's like discrete flows of information.
Flows are reassembled into data doubles, you know, profiles, and then
you, as you, meaning as a profile.
you are scrutinized, and look, you are not just one profile. You can be many.
You can be many profiles. I have my teaching profile. I have my
you know I have my I don't have social media people for all those reasons, right like which, by the way. Now, it's a weird people. Ask why, Don't, you have social media? Because I mean, you know. But anyways, in social media we're not just one that data that we and that's the beauty. Humanity is infinite. We can be many, many, many things right? So, and that's why. That's and that's the danger of surveillance. True, because surveillance dissects us.
Remember the chopping board that sees us, and then you know, it creates all those flows of information which will become profiles.
So it's almost like you have your entire self all mapped up
or mapped out and in out there somewhere in some data storage, right like.
So
he tries to kind of theorize surveillance a little bit, and he he, according to him, this, this sliding here is him trying to theorize surveillance, theorizing, any explaining how surveillance works
so! And then he he! But he goes a little bit deeper into it. So he's gonna say, look.
he's gonna there's some point in there under this heading Theorite service, theorizing surveillance that he's gonna say.
i'm going to build off you know George World 1,984.
And then he's gonna say, yeah, you know. But George World, he never saw
That's he didn't see the technology coming. He never thought that he never saw, never thought that computers and optics up in optic is oh, oh, shoot.
shoot! I said. Shoot people I can. I can't. I can't say the word up, because Anyways, you guys got it. It's on the slide. So you know, like imagery, he would never think that we would get to this, you know, level of, like, you know.
computer computing technology and imagery, technology and and data gathering technology, you know. And they he wouldn't, he, you know, like he got much worse than what he actually that didn't what he could ever imagine. That's what he was saying, and then, haggard, it continues. You know
another kind of mistake. I mean. The first bullet points not really a mistake, but the second one is a mistake
like George George. He imagined the big brother as being the State
right. So the whole time in there's even in the analogy for the Communist societies and everything
but
what hegery says and how he is right. Is that the emphasis.
you know, on the State was too restrictive.
so like think about it, I mean sometimes it's so funny, because people when I tell people that I lived in China. They oh, the Chinese State. They control you. Yeah, true.
But I don't know which one i'm more afraid of. I mean, if it's the Chinese State or the Canadian State, or the American State, or if it is actually the private corporations, Google Meta, you know Amazon, because you know the state.
It's almost like the State needs to kind of always go back to us and our needs. As citizens, you know, so especially in democratic societies like the State, you know he has in us.
I mean they. At this they they try to push the idea that I mean the state and and the politicians that work in the State.
and the bureaucrats want to form the State. They say you know they kind of they are driven by public public. Well.
well-being
right so, but private company
they are driven entirely by
profitability.
So I don't know which one i'm more afraid of right, but anyways, but but but he's right. So I mean, the big brother is not just the state the big brother could be Google. It could be anyone. But we immediately. When we think about surveillance. We think about the state we don't think about. Oh, well, now we're kind of changing, I hope the mentality. But you know
private companies.
and in many cases they have even. They have much more
on this stage, and they are, you know, in this
often doesn't have the power to
It's any kind of law on them
in 1,984.
Well, he says that only the reach is under surveillance. It's almost like the big brother. The State doesn't care about the
pros like the people who are, you know, the very shabby poor, you know, stigmatized people.
The State leaves them alone in 1,984 there is there is even a like a special.
So there's the idea of, like the exclusion you know, that comes from the
the lap leper that we discussed so like a 19, you know, inside of 1,984 there is kind of a a leper society, that process society where you exclude people
and heger it goes. No, no, no! In today's world, everybody.
There is nobody being excluded. You can be a homeless person.
You are
in the right. You're not under.
Well, you are in the radar, I mean. You are being surveilled right? So
so he's gonna so like, you know he he builds it's almost like he builds. He kind of he dialogues and kind of criticize, so he can kind of say, oh, Look, my surveillance assemblage is better than you know
then using, you know, 1984 big broader big brother is not the best analogy. My surveillance assemblage is the best analogy. So that's why he's kind of building a dialogue, say, oh, you know he didn't think about that. He didn't think about this.
So he he also builds off full call, and that's why I have the panopticon for you here, which is actually from Bentham. But Fukuo used Bentham's an option right so
full call. According to Hagerty. It's it's very important, because it's situate surveillance within a theory of power. Really, I can't remember you saying that, as I said. I told you you look surveillance, influence. It governs us. It changed our behavior.
So it's Pop, the power right like it change our behavior, and it doesn't even have to be in a brutal way, like the guy in the Ted Talk. Glenn Greenwald also talks about that. It's in the surveillance changes our behavior in ways that it's much more serious and even like drop dramatic
or drastic, than than using brute force. You know, he says, that in the Ted talk. So surveillance is about power. We we kind of established that a while ago.
So in Heger says, yeah, that that that was something good that did that for Course said, and
the panoptic and outers people's relationship with themselves. Yes, it does. And we discuss that, too, and even like Greenwald, the Ted Talk guy. He also talks about this. How you know the fact that you don't know that you are under surveillance. That changes you, you know.
you know. But the thing is that he's gonna say, look for. Call took power away from the institutions.
So because usually we used to think of power in in terms of
institutions like, okay, school family, you know, Workplace Fuko says no power is anywhere everywhere
because it's about like, you know, Surveillance somewhere is just guiding you. So power is not necessarily inside of the institutions, and Haggard appreciates that. You right? So I said, okay.
And and then he also likes, like, you know, fucose concept of disciplinarian society that that he discussed before. So his concept of disciplinarian society, or, you know, disciplinary society, which is a society where every aspect of life is managed right like so.
anyway. So he's kind of, you know, recapping all those ideas
in his ass.
Focal even improves all those ideas that you know that only the reach is scrutinized. You know
the rich people are scrutinized for focal. Everyone is scrutinized. Yeah, true, you know.
and you know. But he says, just like the loose Foucault could not predict that technology would advance so much, and that, you know, surveillance would get so massive.
And then he says, Perhaps we should not even talk in terms of panopticon. Panopticon is not enough. That tower. The image is not enough.
Maybe we need something called super panopticon or electronic panoptic. And he says, but actually where he's getting it into is just like his surveillance assemblage. That's where you right to say, okay, oh, Don't. You know that big, broader analogy is not good. This is not. That's not good. It's incomplete and disciplinarian society or disciplinary society is not
enough. Choose not complete, you know, super panacea, and maybe might not. Do, you know, electronic, but not do so. He's trying to find this idea like to some sort of concept that can actually explain what's happening, and
that's what his surveillance assemblage does right. So
let's look at the surveillance assemblage. Take a look at it. Let me see. Okay, 1 h.
Okay. So here he leads with the lege and what he? Okay.
So he's gonna say that the idea? He's gonna talk a little bit about how this idea of assemblage came to him.
So he's going to say he came from the loose, and he came from. But but he.
because, like both
what he and the lose, the way that they look the world, the way that they analyze anything, it could be the spin, it could be, you know it could be this cup. It could be someone walking down the street down there. It could be me giving out this lecture
the way that those 2 philosophers they analyze the world is in terms of. They always look for multiplicity.
they always looking for multiple factors. So they don't analyze the factor just one factor. They always analyze factors in Combo or in assemblages.
and they always think of that. You know that there there is always a a multiplicity of reasons why, of about about why something happens. So that's why they don't just look for one thing. They look for many things assemblage, and they always think that you know social phenomena.
whatever that is, it could be divorced, it could be, you know, and a sexual South could be whatever that is, you know, an act of racism. They always think of that as fluid, like the way that they approach the phenomenon. They think okay, this can change.
you know, and indeed they can change, because someone who is racist today may not be tomorrow. That person may educate themselves about race. And then they say, oh, you know my! You know I was bigoted. I was I you know I I I
you know. Anyways, I mean, we change. We human beings we change, and and that's the point about free fluidity. And then they they think about in terms of flows. So things they happen in flow. I mean, that's their way of analyzing social phenomena. Okay, doesn't mean that we have to agree. You just need to understand where it's coming from.
and they always think about the wheel that, like you know, wheels, desires, so they say, Look, there is always a desire. So someone's walking down the street right now.
Probably they have to go up because they're going to work. It's not their desire. But maybe you know the motivation to go to work which they don't like is for a greater thing which is their desire. I mean, there is always some sort of desire involved. Right? So that's how they see the world
and in Hager to go. Kind of. You know.
He drinks it. It kind of, you know. It draws
from from there this kind of mindset.
So here, like some characteristics of the surveillance assemblage.
So there is intersections of various media that can be connected for diverse purposes, and that's what we see
when we think about Facebook surveillance, camera, surveillance, whatever. There is always various medias that are connected there's there's always intersections on things in there, so there's an assemblage
so whenever we think about surveillance. They can be at Doc.
This is Latin, a dock, a doc.
I. It means made on the spot more spent to spontaneous.
so surveillance, or.
you know, like the surveillance, a sandwich can be a doc made on the spot, or it can be more institutionalized. It can be something more stable. It can be something that you do as you go right. So
you know. And we when I say that that I mean even like the algorithms I mean, like the you know, the like social media platforms. They don't know exactly what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do. So they have the algorithm set for stuff that they predict.
and they might have. You know, algorithms in there set for things that it's they they haven't predicted, and then, once they see it, it becomes a prediction. Then, you know, you know, like
our behavior, because again, you and behavior is predictable, but not fully predictable. So that's why surveillance can be a doc, and or it can be more to to institutionalize.
So there is no boundaries. So the surveillance, I mean the way that surveillance works in society there is a total lack of of boundaries, and even like there is not like really responsible governmental departments. I mean, you know, in it doesn't even have to be government. It can be private sector, right? And just like we said, I mean
so. So so surveillance doesn't. Really, we don't really know where it starts, where ends, what kind of data is being collected? What is not right like it cannot. Surveillance cannot be dismantled by just saying you're not going to use this technology if you say, oh, you know, i'm not going to use Facebook that doesn't mean that you're going to be off surveillance
right? So it's like it's something much bigger than just like, and that's why I I I kind of enjoy. Sometimes I find this this concept.
Oh, I I find it very useful, and I like it a lot sometimes. So you know, i'm a little bit kind of, you know. There's not really like it's just like him kind of reflecting on.
you know, and bringing together ideas from others. But it's okay, but still, like, you know. So sometimes as a research, I mean sometimes like oh, this is very useful. Sometimes I find it's not. But but the point is, this is really it's really, really an important concept inside of surveillance studies. So
so, anyway, so it's like, you know. So it's not just about the technology. You can't just squash all the cameras.
you know. You you'll still be under surveillance, and the cameras will come back. I mean
you. You criticize, you know you criticize the government bureaucracy or whatever bureaucracy Google bureaucracy whatever is not going to stop surveillance or the surveillance assemblage
so, and the surveillance assemblage, or this concept targets the body.
you know, like the monitored body, is becoming a cyborg.
right? And it No, it's for
think about dogs. It doesn't have to be humans. It can be dogs right like blogs. They have ships like chips like you can put a chip on your dog, and you know where your dog is, or even us like you know, some people there actually, you know, in the text he talks about someone who actually put a
a a chip under their scheme, and some people they do that.
But you know. But the the fact is that I mean we are becoming site boards because we have. You know I have my cell phone here. I have whatever here, I mean, I have all this, you know. Some people actually get on their thing, but and also even like now, if Bio surveillance and digital, I mean.
You know my body is, it becomes the instrument of surveillance, like my fingers Are the instrumental surveillance. Right? So that this is the idea of a sideboard that you become a tool of surveillance to surveillance yourself. So it's like, you know
your your I. That's why, in the beginning of the course, I had this image of a woman that I got from. You know I got for you from Microsoft, like you know, this woman like, with her face kind of you know the i's, and so
so the the body it has. It has all its movements fully monitored and recorded. So that's how it goes right. So
look, people. I know my time is almost up. But let's just keep push a little bit here.
so how to analyze the surveillance like the surveillance assemblage. How do you analyze that? The you are the words? How do you analyze today's surveillance?
You have to focus on the capabilities of a number of discrete technologies or social practices. So if you're going to study surveillance, you have to look at your capability. What is it that the surveillance thing you can do
right like you have to highlight the floor. Proliferation.
you know, of of surveillance, and they emphasize how they can cumulatively pose a threat to civil liberties. You know.
But again, this is not so much about taking size, like good or bad, but the understanding does it pose a threat to humanity? Also
you got to appreciate that surveillance is driven by the desire to bring systems together.
Can you see the desire plane, and even by our desire to integrate this system, because again we do it.
We are happy to give our data, for we name of convenience and exchange for something cheaper for a coupon for whatever we do it. There is desire in there can see. That's why he, you know that's the inspiration here.
Remember that surveillance operates not only within the State and by the State. But surveillance comes from extra state actors.
private companies.
and that's why it's so important for canada that you passed that bill, you know, c. 27 that discussed earlier.
and consider that surveillance
affects oops. There's it's missing. As here affects surveillance effects.
Oops. There's not the everyone you know affects everyone
not only you, me, or the rich or the poor. It's everyone right so in different different ways, though.
And then he goes on to say that surveillance assemblages, surveillance, assemblages. Every side of the surveillance is changed to surveillance surveillance of sandwiches. They are like your rhizom or his on on francet rhizons
they are like horizontal plants. You know that they kind of spread you chop them here, they grow elsewhere, you chop them elsewhere. They grow elsewhere, which is for those of you who like cooking. Is it, Ginger?
I forgot the name of this in front of like on it's Ginger
ginger in English is like a ginger ginger is like that
pick
generic Truman
turmeric. I don't know
it is like that. So you're chopping.
There's no hierarchy.
hey? Go?
Oh, like you know no it's like
right. So
so that's
for today's surveillance. Right? So
conclusion, people. The conclusion here is the design
disappearance. Think, take it, take a second. So keen
disappearance of disappearance.
It's nearly impossible to disappear in today's world, and that's why that is one of the for our Sa exam like that. You're gonna have to write me in this. Say, I gave you 2 options. One is about Covid
like how you know Covid, impact that surveillance another one is about. How would you disappear?
You're going to see if you take that.
That is, say, you know that your your your job is to disappear
up here. You're gonna see, it's nearly impossible, you know.
So the final message here
surveillance, assemblage, and this is him saying: surveillance, assemblage marks the progressive
disappearance of disappearance as a process
whereby it is increasingly difficult for individuals to monthly there and on Imagey. So it it's almost like you know it marks it's it's a progressive disappearance of disappearance. It is impossible for you to keep yourself anonymous, and that goes back to the beginning of here.
The whole thing I mean what, Darren, it she was to be anonymous. And now
that will then that understanding of mother and just gone
right? So
identities are becoming institutionalized through different profiles. I mean.
when I say institutionalized like it's like it's like it's it's managed by companies by institutions not necessarily public
private sector, too.
and almost it's almost impossible to one day and anonymity, the the the Flanner from the disappeared.
and nothing can they evade technologies devoted to to the disappearance of disappearance. So essentially a surveillance technology is a technology that is devoted
to the disappearance of the disappearance. And then he says he ends in a very beautiful way. He talks about the D-day.
The day is the invasion of Normandy in France, when in the Second World War, when Hitler was taking over Europe, especially France.
like Hitler's army, was taking over all over, and then the Allies, led by the United States and Canada Also
they landed.
Oh, I see someone is logging in in class. I think it's Lily
the Lee. You are welcome. I'm just finishing recording for us. Okay, just so, you know.
So let me. Just so it If he finishes in a very beautiful way, just saying, Look, you know that d-day situation, that probably you guys, you, you had a little bit of history world war true history in school. So did did they was all the Allies. If they are like us, Canada. They came
like they like they were away from the beach. Actually I went there. It's beautiful me. It's sad to you know. So they were they all those beaches, and like the Allies, with all their you know, in their in their you know, their Armada, in their boats and in in, you know. So they were in there
ready to attack.
and you know, in defend France, and then they were waiting for the fog to lift.
you know. So they were like heat them behind the fog, waiting for that for which to live so they would literally attack. And that's exactly what happened. And, as you guys know, I mean, i'm sure you know a little bit of the that the day history a lot of people died, you know. There is, even like Canada has a museum in there, and everything anyways.
But the idea is that I mean that he says in today's world
that did they image where you have the Allies hidden
behind the fog so just they can, you know. Once they become visible, they they
appear in the attack, and in the end was very successful. They managed to free, started with France, and then all over Europe. And then, you know, like the Allies, they they finish the war victories. So that would be possible in today's world. Okay.
So, people, that's it. So i'm gonna.
you know.
I'm down to 1 min here. So that's it from my side. We're going to talk again next class
in person, and you guys take care. Stay Well.
and if you have any questions you email me or wait until Tuesday. Okay, you're gonna be together again.
You take care. Thank you very much, and I am going to stop recording
by people.
"

Feb 7

"Hello, everybody, Welcome back. Do you see me? Do you hear me?
Yes, N0 0kay. Yes. Good. So how is everybody doing? Are you guys doing well.
Okay.
Tired people are tired. It's been okay. Yeah.
Okay. So let me start folks happy to see you guys here to have you on board again.
I actually now I I think I don't mind online lectures anymore. As long as I have you guys here, Sometimes I feel weird when you know i'm talking like an hour into my lecture, and then like oh, my gosh! Is there anybody listening to me? But you know
you know I I think i'm getting used t0 0nline life, and I I actually enjoy. Now, do you guys enjoy like this kind of lecture where it's live? And you know.
or you still prefer the in person lecture.
Yeah, I think I like to mix to like you guys, some of you and I see you have a lot of dates coming up. So let's talk about our our our exam a little bit. Okay, people saying that's mixed, and I I like that you
people exam. There's nothing to fear. Okay.
So first of all, before we actually talk more about it, Did you guys have the time to to go in the Sam again and take it again with your video, and like full blown surveillance.
did you have the chance to do that? Did that work for you? He has No?
Oh, gosh, nobody but just one person.
Okay. So for those of you wh0 0kay, so more people. Okay. So it worked. You had to turn on your camera. You had to turn on your mic, and everything was okay, right, like.
Did you find?
Yeah, it is Matthew. I also find it. This is just awful. I hate the educational system. I love teaching. I love doing research. I love exchange with you for folks, but I like I just like the bureaucracy of it, I mean, anyways, and encoding, you know.
Yes, we are, Joey. So it's a comb0 0f a Sam and Exam. Block. Okay, so so please go in there and try the template exam that I did for you like a mock exam that I did for you. Not yet. 0 0kay, okay. So yeah. Oh, that's a problem, Selena. You're gonna need
You're gonna need a a PC. Or some sort of actual real computer for for the exam.
So people would like to ask you again, just going there and try it out.
And so you should be. You shouldn't be facing any problems. I know that a few people wrote to me. I believe that, I answered. Everybody's concern.
If there is, if I forgot to answer anyone here. But it's just Marcella. You can feel free to just put in the chat and recently forgot me my email, or send me a direct or or or email. I mean just so because I mean, I was traveling last week, and things were a little bit crazy.
Yeah. S0 0n the test day you're gonna go through, Sam. And then you're gonna be like the then from there there is the code, the instructions for you t0 0pen a a open exam. Lock it's gonna be exactly the same the mock that I have for you. So please do the mock. So you can be sure that you know exactly how it works. Okay.
and in terms of does it clarify joy
like you? You know, don't be concerned just going there to the mock, because if the more mock works, I mean, then it's gonna work during the exam time.
Look, people, the exam will be class time. I know that some of you you're going to be in between classes, and you won't. Have the time to go back home to, you know, to do it or find a private place.
You feel free to do it in the library feel free to do in a place where it's a public place. But like again, you're gonna have to keep your camera and mic open so I can see you during the exam, or I can go and check your recording later, if I need to. So don't be concerned about overs. If i'm on a public space.
It might flag me, because, you know, some people might walk behind me, you know, like if i'm in the library or something. It's fine by me, because what I will do is if the system flags you, I will go and check your recording, and I will be okay. This person is in the library, so it's fine, you know, like I can. I can see it. I can hear right. The recordings and the surveillance is there for me to check.
so I can check, and I can tell. So yeah. So, Jessica, it's gonna be during class hours exactly like that class hours
for those of you, just in case I don't know if there anybody here but for those of you who have accommodations, you will get your accommodation as usual. So for you. You're gonna go and Sam on on, on, on the Sam Icon. And then you're gonna find like i'm gonna put 2 exams in there. One. I'm gonna call it a like, just exam another one. I'm gonna call, because then, with accommodations, s0 0nly please take only take the accommodation. Exam
If you have officially approved accommodations. Don't just going there. All I'm gonna take this. No, no, no. If you don't have, I mean accommodations approved by the University, you cannot take that exam. You have to go to the normal one. Okay.
yes, our test is not until the sixteenth.
But I know that, you guys you. You're having a lot of dates now, and probably the anxiety is kind of kicking, and I don't want anybody anxious. What I would like to tell you is that this first exam.
the the that, like the difficulty in terms of difficulty, is going to be an easy exam. Okay. So it's going to be very kind. The the questions that I gave to you on the mock exam. I believe that they are fairly easy. Are they?
Did you guys for those of you who took the walk? Did you notice how easy the questions are?
They're very straightforward, Very kind of you took the lecture. Even you're going to be able to do them. So you know they're going to be that lab. It's going to be an easy exam. So does it mean that you don't have to study, you know the opposite, because it's going to be easy. I'd like you to go. It's going to be multiple choice. I would like you to go and study because it's going to be easy.
So if you study, you're gonna get like you're gonna do very well, and then you won't. Be as concerned for the final exam, which is cumulative. Do you guys understand me? So it is multiple choice. Okay? And it's gonna be easy.
The low floor, I see. No, I don't you look us. You are talking about curvy and stuff like that, right like that's what I imagine. When you say low floor and high ceiling. Is that like you? I don't know exactly what you mean by that. But what I can tell is that there's no curves or anything. It is what it is.
and it's gonna be a knees Exam: so. And why? Because i'm making it easy. Because I know that the final exam is cumulative. It's gonna be the entire course, and I know that it's a lot.
and I know that at the end of the this the term you guys are exhausted. So I would like you to go in there and do your best in this exam, just, you know, like, Go as high as you can, study as much as you can, you know. Make sure you know all the content and
and and and there you go. You know you're going to have a very nice score, and you have some cushion for the future over some. Is that because the the finance exam is gonna be hard? No, it's because you're you will be tired
because it's gonna be the end of the term, and in this, because it's cumulative. So I know that's harder. I mean, you get. You know people are more there. You guys tend to be easier at the end of the term. Okay, so that's what i'm doing here. I I have not prepared the exam yet.
I will prepare part of the exam this weekend and the other part of the exam. Let's see here.
Yeah, no. I'll have to prepare this weekend, because next week is going to be the exams right. So not to this Thursday, but that the August Thursday. So this weekend I will prepare the exam, and what I'm gonna do early next week. I am gonna like on on the thirteenth or the fourteenth.
I will send you a more kind of I i'm gonna send that class an email with. Okay, I will have X number of questions on on those readings on this reading X X. Number of questions reading Zed in X number of Questions, and the questions I told you earlier.
not or you today, but earlier in the course they are going to be an overlap. They're going to be like staff that are covered in the class, and also in the reading, so like it's going to be of like a 100% or nearly a 100% overlap
again doesn't mean that you just the class can do it. You don't need to read. I would recommend you to read because I could. I could. I could phrase it in a way that
you know that. Oh, unless you have red, or or that, unless you really know the topic. You you you're gonna, I mean, when I say really, those like you meant to call you came to class, and you actually read. And then oh, I know what you're talking about. I know that maybe there is. You know, something in here that you know that that she didn't quite she covered in class, but she didn't explore as much as in the reading, so anyways. But i'm gonna give you a menu of what's going to be on the exam more detailed the menu. But do not wait for me because you're gonna have the weekend.
So take a look at the materials, you know, like Don't, don't be waiting. Okay, I'm gonna wait until like on the 13 0r fourteenth when she sends out this list, and then i'm gonna go and just do like you know that I mean you can. I mean your choice. But I I recommend it to read, and i'm gonna try to distribute the questions.
you know, in terms of balanced I'm gonna try to balance them out. So every reading gets the same amount of that of questions. I don't know yet how many questions i'm gonna put in there, but I believe I believe it's gonna be 50. So let's see. You know I mean, i'm gonna be doing it this weekend, you know.
So is this clear? Do we have any question or any concern about the exam that you'd like to meet your address right now. Obviously, you can always talk to me through email. If you have anything specific you can stay for off hour, but you also can address right now, if you have any question or concern about the exam.
Yes, Jenna, thank you for your question. It will be the full hour. S0 0ur class starts at at 3 30. So that's what we're gonna start. And then yes, exactly. It's gonna be like 1 h and 20 min. That's what our course is. So so i'm gonna prepare. I mean, obviously, i'm not crazy. So keep in mind that you just have 1 h and 20 min. So you're not gonna. You're not gonna have like, you know, a 100 questions. No, it's gonna be like around 50,
you know. I expect something around. I Usually I usually d0 50 questions from my Midterms, and I do questions that are, you know, that are easy to read. I try to make it them easy to read and kind of flowy. So you guys can just like, you know.
The only thing that I ask you guys is to read for you to read the actual outline of the question carefully, because quite often sometimes people, they come back to me and say, You know we're selling this this question here, and then I say, oh, great! Let's g0 0ver it together. And then
I tell the person, okay, could you? Could you do you mind reading it first, so we can g0 0ver, and once the person reads the outline of the question, the person tells me all over so I can't believe it. I did not read this properly. I mean I knew the answer, you know. So just people I've thought this is my course. Number 51, so I've
since 2,017. So I teach a lot, and not only at the of a. And I can tell you, statistically speaking, the biggest problem that my students face
overall. They do very well. My, my my grading is like it's it's straightforward, and people do get with grades. But the main problem is that people don't read the outline, and then they come to me, and then they come to see me. Oh, I knew it was like, yeah, what do you do right like
so.
Yes, Matthew, I will set the exam in a way that you can go back and forth, and I think the mock exam was like that. Right you you you you you! You! You know I I can. I didn't pay attention to it because you have to take a box.
But I will do that. When I prepare the example, make sure that I take that box that allows you guys to go move back and forth.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, Matthew, a lot of the pros. They don't let you go back and forth. But I I don't care. I mean, I I mean, if you know, you know. I mean, you know, I think it's fair to let you guys see the questions more. I mean, you know as much as you need.
Okay. So yeah. So you're going to be able to.
Okay any other question or concern about the extra exam.
Those are good.
So don't be afraid. I just ask you that I mean, you know. Get all the all, the the stuff that we cover your notes, you know. Revise everything. Take a look at the the the, you know the readings, and then you're good to go.
Yes, I actually did that. I believe, Jessica. But if not, I did that, I think I have a link on top of the page of our request. But i'm gonna take notes here to triple check. And also i'm gonna to date regardless. I'm gonna put another link in there because I recently, because one of my students here, one of our colleagues
emailed me about to something about the exam lock. And then, like the e-class team they wrote, they gave me another link. That's better or that is more comprehensive. So today, after class, i'm gonna post that, you know. So
but I but again, the best thing is, I just do the mock, which is just 6 questions very easy, very quick. Just so. You try the technology.
Okay.
Hey, people, let me get started here.
so probably you can see me. I think. I hope. Let's see it's opening up.
Just duplicate this thing.
Okay.
So here we go. I see, you guys, if you don't hear me. If you don't see me, or if something is off. Just let me know in the chat here because I I can see Where's the chat?
0 0kay, here's the check. Okay, I am here with you.
So look, people! I'm gonna start. Actually, I I wanna before we actually go to today's
topic. We are still. Now we are doing the the theorizing surveillance part, too. I would like to share something with you that is student of mine shared with me around 2,018
or 2,019,
and I actually forgot to share this with you, and I really want you to see this. So this is student named Stacey Simpson. She graduated long time ago. So she was from Corey, and very, very good student, like very good analyst, and she was going one day in the morning. It was winter. She was driving to Concordia.
and she saw this bus.
and when she saw this bus she sent, she took a picture and send it like you mail that to me and email to me the feature.
because, like in my social problem class, I had said something about that. And then you know. But why am I bringing this to you here
because that article by Delus about it's called the Pollscript on the Society of of Control.
like we discussed that article, and if you guys remember
but one thing that i'm not sure if I if I brought that up, I think I did in class. But I wanna I wanna bring that up.
There is at some point in the article, he says. who needs prison? He doesn't say like that i'm paraphrasing here, but that's the idea. But he goes like who needs reason.
you know, like like. And he was talking about how control and society's modulated and how control is continuous. We discuss that in class. Okay? And and then he says, Who's who needs reason when we have that in society?
I don't know if you guys think about this, but I don't know, because I mean the U. Of a. Is a university where we have a lot of international students wh0 0bviously have some sort of money from their families, otherwise they can be able to fully survive here, or even pay the tuition fees, which is extremely expensive for underground degrees like I here? It's about like
30 $40000, even more, depending on the course for per year.
helpless the cost of living but but anyways, but like so like the you of a what i'm trying to say is the u of is kind of a reach. People's school, I mean it like the the income lab at the of a is kind of upper upper class. So we have a lot of like international students who have money.
We have a more. Our very good scholarships. We have a lot of first generation Canadians especially like from Asian communities who really value
like like in school and schooling, and they they they pay, and they really make. They wanna make sure that your kids go to the best schools in the country, and we also have the local people who are, you know, who have like, who's parents, now help to pay? So the you of a perhaps from based on my in person classes and my conversations with my students.
The that level is not so high. When I do that. That inquiry in class I mean it's about $30,000, you know $40,000. But when I go to Concordia that that level because concord is mainly first-generation Canadians and but a lot of them from in in like the the history of immigration of their parents, is different. Like it's people who arrived in Canada's refugees, or people who arrived in Canada is a manual in like manual workers immigrants. So it's like.
So it's different. I mean you don't come from very, very rich families, and I don't like the UV. So that that level I can forward is much higher, like I see students at 80 $90000. I like that.
So anyways I don't know what you guys are at, but having a that like starting your life as a back. With that I mean it's just like it. It's not easy, folks, and Canada is doing much better than let's say our neighbor, the United States, where people graduate with 400000 500000dollars in that.
So here it's just about 50 60, depending on the school, but still, like you know, and and for those of you who are in that it becomes a clock, a kind of very strong form of control that that that follows you around because
it it. It stays with you all the time. Okay, you g0 0ff to your friends. Okay, but it has to be a cheap place, because, you know, I cannot acquire more debt or I'm gonna do this. I can't, because I have that there's a job that I don't like, but you know i'll take it because you know, whatever it forces you, we guides your behavior. So I really like to what to do. Is it really like? I read that text
the first time. I probably I was at your age 1918 0r between 18 and and 20
years old, and that stayed with me, You know, like this thing that he said. Okay, why do we even need to prison? Because it's almost like everybody's in prison, because everybody is in that. And last time I checked in Canada, like in Canada. On average, we have. I have to kind of go check this information again.
But according to the central bank of Canada, information from the central bank of Canada last time I checked, which I think was 182018, the each Canadian old.
1.8 $4 like $1 and 84 cents for each dollar that they make.
Is it clear what i'm what I'm saying? Here, guys, are you there.
Now is the time that I just like. I need you to give some to say I am. Here we are alive, and and you are not talking to the walls. Okay, Good. Okay. So are you guys thinking about what i'm trying to say Here it it follows you. I don't want to put people on the spot. I don't You don't need to share your stories, because
quite often they're very stressed when, and you know well. But if you want to share your share. But yeah, I said, in 2,018 you can like a Joey, please do me a favor. As i'm talking. Go in Google Central Bank of Canada and put that per person. But when I last time I checked was 1.8 4. I'm gonna put here in the chat.
Okay. So for each dollar that Canadians make, they would all 1.8 4. That's a lot of people the level of that.
I mean. It's like, you know. It's just so colossal. It's huge, right? So. And imagine this stress levels. I actually had a student from Aquarium after that course that I gave there the this, the same course where this Stacy she came with this picture. I recall that after my lecture my student of mine came to my office hours and shared with me that her uncle
committed suicide, and obviously we never died from suicide. Right? That's the best way to say so. Died because she said a lot of crime. So we don't say, commit to suicide. But, like her Uncle Don died from suicide.
and the family doesn't know why to why, and obviously I mean for someone to die from suicide. I mean, there's mental health issues involved. But the family also believed that the that
had something to do with it, because this uncle of my student was pretending for his family that everything was okay.
So like the family had money, Everything was okay, like, you know, no problems. But then, after his death, the family found out that there was like a huge like that in the bank that all the money, even for groceries. It pretty much like they were broke.
you know, but they didn't know that until after, because the guy passed, and then, like they had to, you know, take over like the you know, the bank things and everything. And then they went, and then, you know, they realized that they were broke. So the the family think that has to do with that. So
but anyway, so I. I just brought this here. So you guys think about like forms of control
and surveillance and and and surveillance is time to to that, to that, especially now that I mean it's cashless economy, right? So the banks they know exactly your situation. And in many cases.
Oh, you have. Okay, i'm gonna do that don't you worry because I know the reports. I will go back, and i'll tell you guys, you know i'm going to put a link on the class to the report where you can see this so anyways, so
so like. Look surveillance. Now the banks they know
they know your situation. They know how much money you're making, and they exactly where you're spending My Rbc. Bank account, hey? Has even the feature that they can organize for me. We're selling groceries you spent X in, you know, in pharmacy whatever mad, seeing whatever you spent. X. I mean. You know my my bank has this featuring there that I can just buy just on the website. I don't have to do anything. I just click like something there, and then I can see like charged with where i'm spending. I'm sure that all the banks they have that, and i'm sure that you guys
know exactly what i'm talking about, because
perhaps you've seen it in your big account. So in in exactly another thing, I think I mentioned this.
Yes, the location to Jessica and I i'm not sure if I set that in class, because sometimes it's too much happening, you know. If I said or if I didn't say but regardless, i'm gonna say again.
I usually tell my students look, actually avoid. Look, look at go to the bus. It's so funny. Look at this picture. Actually, I like a now I just. I just noticed something on this picture in front of you that I haven't noticed yet.
and this is not on purpose. I'm sure that even Stacy, the woman who took the pictures. You don't pay attention. Can you see that there is an advertisement for a 3 store thrift store like a second hand staff store?
You'll see it. This is an irony, actually, because it's close to that. So you're like You're in that. You go shop cheap. And then what happened is you like you, you you, the bank gets your location, and that impacts your price, credit store credit score. So
I tell my students look.
no matter what happens. Be very careful with where you spend your credit card. So if you like, because some people see some people they need to save money. But some people They seem to like
shopping, you know, in in thrift shop stores, like, you know, they find nice things. They find things that are very good, and and you know, and but if you can, I would highly recommend you to pay with money. You get some money, and then you don't pay cash, because, like the banks. They do exactly that, you know, and they map you. They see what locations you're spending money, what kinds of neighborhoods, and that all you've seen, your all that information built into your credit score.
And a while ago, also, when I was preparing to teach social problems, what is it wasn't? Even surveillance, I came across
a report. I think that's from 2,015 from the the Us. Congress, like they had kind of. They had an inquiry
about this like this practices that all the banks they don't you, you know, to map you where you're spending and and and put that information in your you know when you're gonna apply for a loan or a student loan, or to buy a via vehicle, or to buy a home, a mortgage. And so they built that information, and then at that time 1415, the United, the Us. Congress.
They did not deem that illegal, like, you know, in the end, but they they promise to pass legislation. That would kind of make it harder for banks to do that. However, you know, we all know that. I mean. You know that that that doesn't really it's really hard to control that kind of stuff.
So
yeah, so location location and but I think location Jessica is more like where you shot.
you know, and like where you live, and where you where you shop and where you live. Those are the things that really matter. Not so much. I mean, if you are circulating in poor areas, you know, or in in low income areas.
Bm: always sites. Tell me exactly. Yeah, You see, Gre. I mean exactly that. So I get a lot of your time from bank about traveling visas, or whatever
I did a few I had to do booking for the conference and etc., etc. stuff in Vancouver, and and after I did the booking for the conference, and then I go, I start to get like booking
booking.com like, you know, for me to find a hotel invoke over, you know. So me, you know, because I mean when you go those websites, and they they ask, Look, do you accept the cookies? I mean, they They're creating information, you know, and they sell that information right. So
yeah, they know all the definitely. No, Matthew. And now so another thing that i'd like to share with you guys, what we're spending too much time here and have to go. What I want to share with you, Matthew, is that cameras? Now, I would like to tell all of you here in this class today to be very, very careful not to give your credit card
to n0 0ne. If you, your boyfriend girlfriend, your partner, your loved one, whoever that is someone that you trust the most. Why? Because Banks, now, what they do is a lot of the cash machines, or even point of sale.
They like they they collect data on on your face facial data. Okay.
So let's suppose I give Matthew my credit card because I really trust Matthew, I know that Matthew won't take my one or anything, so I give my credit card and say, look, go to save home foods and buy something for me, you know. Here's my card, I mean, which is something that we could, you know. I mean, that's not hard to do that in life.
and then, like, you know, and let's suppose that I you know, a couple of week later I may I? You know someone steal my credit card, and I get some fraud on on my credit card, and then I compact the bank. The bank will do. They will do everything that they can to get away from paying me back.
So they're gonna say that I am a risk that I am a royal liability. And how do they do that? They go? Check
the less times that I, with the real money, the less checks that I the last time that I use my credit card, and if those points of say you have a camera, they will engage with that in. As for for the surveillance of of footage, and if it's not me and and for atms, they don't even ask you. You don't need to ask anybody, because they do have access to that. I don't need to notice. Every ATM has a little camera on top of it. So they check that. And if it's in, if there once in a lifetime.
you know
the like, the machine flagged you, because you know it was Matthew with Marcelus card. Then they're gonna come back to my 7. Say, look, Marcel, i'm so sorry you breached security. You shared your card of someone else. And therefore, you know we are not gonna cover. We're not going to reimburse you for the fraud
or we're not not going to be responsible for, you know, for this money that disappeared from your in your account, or for this transaction. So so they use that against you. So you have to be very, very careful, you know.
because a lot of people who have partners long term partners. They switch cards right, because, you know, you know, you get you give your partner to pay whatever and vice versa. So avoid doing that. Okay, because if something happens, they're gonna use that against you, because you do have data quite often, not all the time, but
they more often than not They do have the data.
Okay, people. Let's skip going. Look: today's class. We're going to discuss a large call
by
by someone named a. A. Jill
Rosalind. Okay. So Rosa leed like she's, she's actually British.
And this is a chapter in a book called Surveillance Out. The book is called the Handbook Handbook of Contemporary Feminism. Okay, and the chapter is called Surveillance is a feminist issue.
Let me let me just think here with you guys, before I start.
I mean well, this specific like topic in the lecture.
Let me ask you guys, first of all do you identify as a feminist person again? This is not about shame or anything. It's like, you know. It's simple. I mean, because I know that now, you know. I mean, if you don't, I don't identify, or if you would, if I can be problematic, but like. But do how, what do you think about what comes to mind when I say feminism.
and do you identify to whatever it comes to your mind? I mean it can be whatever that is. I mean, if you feel, if you feel comfortable enough to share with me
anybody feminism, what is that? What comes to mind? I mean it doesn't have to. I'm not going out for any text. You know. It's like what comes to your mind. And do you identify to whatever comes to your mind?
Okay, i'll go first year. I do. When I think about feminism like I forget about sociology. And just think about feminism. I think about some sort of movement that tries to make gender standards more flexible; that, therefore, that you know, that allows for people like me, for example, like a woman in short hair, and allows for me to have my short hair. And we fought people, Bulini for not having long, long hair, and that, of course, that has a little bit of a history because it goes back to me.
Brazil, I I used to love soccer I used to love. I wanted to be like a an athlete. But in 19 eighties in Brazil soccer was for men, and I suffered a lot because I used to play with men, and and and not only men, but also girls. They would mock me. They would booly need to call me names, and and that was horrible, and I suffered a lot because soccer was my love, and I love playing it.
and but I couldn't get. I never had like soccer things I never had, you know, like a pair of cleats, and never had a nice fall. I never had anything because my mom would not buy for me, because again it was for men, not for women.
So, anyways, I suffered a lot because of those gender standards. So when I think about feminine oh, is it something that's going to liberate me? Okay, I I identify, and that's how I go about it. Okay, this is me first. So let's see what you guys put in here
hypothetically, if you want. Okay, this is, I am a feminist who you're saying. I would say i'm more of an intersection of feminist. So, Jessica, you mean that you also care about other things that overlap like race, I know, like a background like.
and then overlapping with like, you know, gender standards any anyways like Don't. Be more if you if you feel free to share
lily quality, as I also think about quality, call right? Yeah, I know it's just for all intersections. I had this. I think, too, You know, I like the idea of feminism a lot. Yeah, I see it. Okay, I d0 0kay for a. K. For. So I think it. Usually people usually people in the universities. They tend to be very like like they. They get to question, like any kind of standard
in society, that that that dictates how you should be and stuff that kind of oppresses our identity. So usually usually people tend to be a more sympathetic towards a feminist, or or you know, the ideas of feminism. So look a a. And here, but also another question that I have for you. Do you think
that's surveillance like this idea of data collection
can serve the feminist movement or feminist ideas in any way.
I know it's kind of a hard question, but think a little bit can surveillance again, surveillance, meaning data collection surveillance being, you know, the the guiding of behaviors
can surveillance serve
feminism in many way. And also I also like to ask you if surveillance can oppose
feminism in any way in household. I mean, if you, if you care to give me examples.
I agree. Your goals like I think you can work against feminism. Yeah, but I can see that that will tell me how, if you could, if you future share, or to talk, or you know how how you want to feel comfortable if you want, if you want to share
and let's see
people like that. It was the example, from the very beginning of class, where a racialized woman could not get
alone, I think, from a bank
way way more often to racialize women to people with disabilities to people who are not kind of on that top echelon, that upper upper echelon of society.
And that's kind of how I see surveillance working against.
No, this is this is nice. And but you remember from that the same text the same text also said, Look, maybe 1950 0r 60 0r 70 0r eighties, we would have a situation where a person who is LGBT, or a person who is racialized like black.
you know, walks into the bank and ask for money, and let the actual manager says, Look, i'm sorry I can't. I Can't you know I can't even have you here like. Go away, you know. So that was like 19 eighties. And then this, that that's the same tax that told us
you know about, You know, like how like that that woman could not get along. I also kind of countered the it offered her kind of opposite idea, saying, you know, but so the beauty of surveillance. Now that surveillance also works in a way that it's not up to the manager.
Just say, look, I don't. I don't even want you here. Go away. No, the the manager has to put you through the system, and the system can be not always, but it can be can be a little bit more democratic.
You remember that from the same the same high school
I like torture. I mean. It's nice that you brought that up
so. People the same, the same orange poll. So that's the thing to you know, because before was oh, you pinpoint people, and it's almost like the power lies in the hand of one single person, the manager, or that analyst who is doing, you know, who is gonna analyze your your your credit score. And now the analysis of credit. Credit score is more kind of it's the by. Algorithm so it's kind of more. One rule applies to all kind of thing, although
again, it is one rule applied to all. However, it works in a way the algorithm that if you, if you shop too much in a you know, in a 3 shop. I mean, your score is gonna cool down. If you leave in a poor area, your score is gonna go down right, so it's still kind of it's just different, but it's not like
it's. It's the same. But it's different. I don't know if i'm making sense.
So Jessica balls okay, aid or Hindu. Yeah, and that's that's the thing here to. I'd like you to think of examples right like. Let me see, I got a direct message here. I won't say who but like the person, is telling me
just right here?
Yes, because I Some people are saying that sometimes the more talking about like a feminism that sometimes is like, and I I think this is a beautiful, very good comment. A lot of the people say, oh, you know I I oppose feminism, and you know, and I I don't care about that. But actually, I mean we have a lot of empirical evidence out there that we still have a lot of
inequalities and inequities right in terms of gender. So it's hard to dismiss. I mean regardless like a feminism.
Very nice, Coleman. Thank you. Surveillance can also bring exploitation and abuse to the center of discussion. Indeed you can. You know
the case, depend on who is making the already? Exactly so. You're very right. You're very right. And how this is being like projected right like
a surveillance is going to hold people comfort for discrimination.
I think that's her gonna can hold people for explanation, harm for action against women disabled people if he's going to.
Yeah. And there is a side choose for Jenna. Because I mean, yeah, you can. You know you can surveillance something, you know, policing surveillance. And then we use cameras and policing in that. I mean again, discrimination. Is it a crying right so we can in Canada.
Let me just get Jessica here, please, Jessica, go. I see your hand up, just go, and then I i'm gonna read Matthew. And also, yeah, please, i'm using.
Basically I'd even argue that
surveillance and technology is creating like another layer of possible discrimination, because like
I know well, like I live in a residence, and my iphone is t00 0ld to use the laundry
because it's all an app.
and
it's funny. They gave me a laundry card, and they were making fun of me. But, like even the type of technology you use could become a discriminating factor like, I know we're not really in the I guess we kind of have cyborg. So like people with disabilities to use technology, but like
50 years in the future. If you don't have like an up to date, hearing aid or something to help with mobility or eyesight, you could actually, maybe
be discriminated for that, if possible.
Yeah, no, you you heard. Examples are great. I mean, they they're so like to like down to earth like daily life.
They're very, very good. I really appreciate. Thank you for for yeah. And you're I can see that that actually happened to me. I came to this art in view where i'm living now, and and my partner was like, oh, my gosh! You know the laundry doesn't take coins. How we're gonna do it like it's an app, and I have it here. And then my partner's like, 0 0kay, like all relieved, almost like, you know, we're gonna be like we're not going to be able to to do this like, you know, like those little things that people were like, my partner's not very high tech, actually not high tech at all. So like. So anyways, so I I really
I enjoyed it, I know. But thank you. This is really nice.
Through all history patriarchy has promoted women as being seen and not heard in my mind. Surveillance society would expand this view of woman as perhaps more monitored than men, and their opinions are not heard, and and and I I that's Matthew. What you putting here people may people take a look at Matthew's comment.
This is what this is. The main argument of today's article, I mean, you know, like the it boils down to that. Okay, today's article boils down to that. And here are I'm: just completely. I'm: just monitoring view as this view.
as women are perhaps more monitor than men, but their opinions are not heard. I remember reading in our about Tsa agents, like the people who do the transport right to transport agents in the United States
being fired for inspired female passengers on the airports like X-rays. Okay, yeah, really. And that's the point of the article. So if I can our this bubble by by this comment by, you know the balloon here like by Mat Matthew, it kind of gets to the point of the article. But I would like to before we even get to the I would like to tell you people it's not so much about. If men and women are more or less surveillance, if we surveillance surveillance
than men, it's not so much about that. Okay, Matthew, just that that point that you you talk somewhere in there. You say more or less. It is what you're saying, but it's. Try to
try to focus on the types. The thing is that we've surveillance society
women. Yes, like the types of surveillance, is just a bit different sometimes. I mean not always, but sometime, not always, by the way, but sometimes okay. And the point, too, is that I mean surveillance Society could
liberate women and help liberate not. And again, when we think of when we talk about this is very important. I don't know how many men we have here in this class. How many women we have in this class. But when we talk about feminism it's not just about women.
Look people. Feminism is an agenda that it discusses both. I mean it brings an advantages for both men and women. Because, again, if we can undo
those standards for gender, if Marcella can play soccer, and if Marcella can enjoy a ball, and in a jersey and a pair of cleats, you know, because again we are breaking the the North, I mean, i'm outline the Brazilian arms, because in Canada women do play soccer. But like, you know, if if
if Marcel I can play soccer and we flexibility, flexibilize those gender standards that means that you know someone who identifies as men can also, you know, can now. So let's say you where neo polish and and have long hair, or you know what I mean. If, like civilizes.
imagine I have a lot of may have a lot of friends, male friends that they have long hair and and and they identify as males. They they, you know, and and but they have no hair, but like that in the past was not possible. Right? So like flexibleizing gender standards is not just about
women. It's about men, too, I mean. If we do flick to the fixed platform, we we flip the the whole standard for both genders and and for all genders. Now, right? So
so policy would be an example. Yeah. So Jessica has a point. Your phone isn't updated enough. Yeah, and you have to buy it. It comes to a point so that you have to buy another one right like, because I mean, you know. And then, like you, don't you buy or not buy a new phone depending on your money, too? Right? So it's like a very nice comment here.
Okay.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And Greer talks about revenge porn for me at this specific topic. I have not never written about it yet, but one day I will write about this and more. I will tell I 1 0ne day, people you're gonna see an article by me about Porn. Hub: okay.
And because the the classifications like Porn Hub. It is a of you who don't know what that is. A very, very famous porn site.
It's very unregulated. They They have, like they're based in the Uk. But they they they also have like like they have room
like they like. If you file a lawsuit against them in the Uk: They're going to move elsewhere because they do have like branches elsewhere, and they make it nearly impossible for people to get them. And and my problem with that, I mean, I have many problems with the the website, one of them being the way that they classify their videos.
and, like the whole classification, is extremely like like you see, a very strong he total norm behind, you know. It's very like a sexist. Anyways, I have a problem with the way that they classify the videos. Okay and Greer, please go ahead.
Hi: yeah. Well, what I was gonna say about a specifically revenge porn or people losing their jobs due to you know their their importance, finding out only found in the cases. Because I I do know several sex workers in the cases where it's man versus women who is actually losing their job, who is being humiliated
wholly, socially. It it's it's usually just the women. And I actually watch the Pamela documentary last night. I didn't watch the show, but the one that she did herself, and it kind of really brings to light how Tommy Lee he didn't really get any recourse, I mean, of course it was horrible for him, but she lost her entire career.
Nobody would hire her. Nobody took her seriously, and she was the subject of intense humiliation in a way that Tommy Lee wasn't so it's it's just it's just kind of continuation of that, and revenge for it if you
I've ever been to a revenge for insight. Most of it is women on there. Oh, yeah.
And and yeah and all. Yeah, exactly like, yeah.
my one. Another problem here I mean the like, you know the monitoring of the like, the surveillance of power and the surveillance of board, the way that information about Porn is gathered and distributed. It is done in a way that when it comes to the body like you usually see like in any kind of porn like a like video. You see the female face.
and you you see the entire female body, and it's including the face, so meaning that it's you can identify the person, but like in a lot of the port, I would say most, you know porn videos, you see, like you see, like the you don't see the Mayo
face. You see the male body. It's it's very peniscentric, like, you know, follow centric, and but it don't really see. Oh, Marcel Derek. Such exceptions. Yeah, there he is. But like i'm talking about the norm, the norm around the porn world.
right? It is like when you see, have a sexual port. The norm is, you know, the way it's portrayed, and the data that's gathered, and that has a lot of influence in in like in the way that people even perceive their bodies. We see a lot of the women in in in the like. I I I follow a lot. The Ppc. News in the Uk.
And I quite every week I see something like about some teenager who you know, who you know, who committed, who died from suicide, because you know her Vagina did not look like what was supposed to be.
So this teenager goes on. Some porn website sees a bunch of vaginas, you know, and says it goes back, and so mine doesn't look like that. But the the teenager doesn't realize that you know that is a standard of vagina that is portrayed in those movies, right? So the that they don't like all my brass, they don't. They don't realize. Okay. There's screening for people who you know, for for models who actually appear in those shows, or those you know, on those videos.
And and anyway, so like it's a huge problem, not to mention also people committing or dying from suicide because of of revenge for and because their life was completely destroyed, and then that Triggers depression excited Ptsd. And eventually suicide aviation and eventually signed. So so anyways.
Yeah. So
So, people, we went on a tangent here. But back here in the in the topic of today's I mean. Well, this is also part of the topic, but, like the whole thing with the article, I mean it's usually like in sociology and criminology and social sciences usually like we see a feminism in a with a positive lens like it's kind of liberating.
However, what this art was gonna tell us is almost that. I mean, we are creating with surveillance. We are creating a new type of feminism that perhaps is not doing men and women a good job, you know, and and that's we're going to discuss that. Let me present to you.
Oh, I see your comments here.
Yeah, Gregory is talking about the the functional policy, I mean, yeah, thank you. But thanks for your comments. Yeah. you know it, the adapter to you, you know. Anyways, people let's move here. So look
so.
So this so just as just like I like to do. Here is a phot0 0f the book where this article comes from. This is a phot0 0f the the you know, the the professor who wrote this book. She's at the City University of London. Okay, I I like to you guys to know like where the stuff is coming from. So what she's gonna say is that here's the first idea. The first idea that she starts off the you know her. Her article is that we do have a society, a surveillance
imaginary.
So we have this idea. Okay, we are. We are under surveillance, we, you know, like the our cultures kind of in today's world, in 2,000, the you know 20, even like 2000 2000 2020more Recently, in the last 2 3 decades we we tend to think about surveillance. We can just see ourselves under surveillance. We are more kind of aware of surveillance. And so there's this imaginary. Now it's more something that's more cultural. And she gets this idea from.
I think.
who is actually a friend of Dr. Kevin Henry, our Prof. Year at the University of Alberta. So you know, he came up with this, and and so like, when you think about surveillance imaginary, that appears 3 times in the article. No, she's talking about, you know this like the conversation about and around surveillance. Okay, so that's just keep this in mind, and what she's gonna say is that the surveillance imaginary Today Society? It is very. It's very mayocentric.
It is like, dominated by men. So men is usually the actors. They are portrayed as the actors of surveillance. Even when we think about surveillance heroes, as the author put it. I mean, we think about
a green walled the guy that gave a Ted Talk that we walked together. You know we think about him because he has that very famous intercept, even though I know that a lot of you you guys never heard of him, but he's a famous guy in the world of surveillance. So Glen green walled. We we have like snow.
Snow Snowden, so we have a lot of like figures like that. They did leaks major leaks, and they became very famous in the surveillance world. They're all men, and we think of like, whenever we think about someone like doing surveillance on us.
Quite often it comes a a male kind of figure. So we imagine someone behind the camera a. May your body behind the cameras.
you know, and in terms of when we talk about surveillance subjects like the people who are surveillance. Quite often we tend to forget to talk about women. Women never kind of appears, and that's why this author, you know she put a chapter in this book.
you know they made this whole book, you know, like they were their their actions. Many like the handbooks on feminists, but in this one they included one chapter about surveillance, and also Dr. Haggard is has he added, a collection, also a root ledge collection on surveillance, and he included a few chapters about feminism. He did not write them, but he invited people to write about that. So anyways, the B. The point here is that usually women. They are outside of surveillance. I mean, they're in there.
you know. We we never talk about women and surveillance, and this is a huge site that needs a lot of attention and study. So for those of you who are considering to do your
on our thesis or your grad school, or if there is something they want to work with surveillance, I mean in some capacity, you know, like to. For you to think about Women's surveillance is a way to go. There is a lot of incentive and encouragement for that, including scholarships. So before we move on here, it's just kind of I got this here from the sociology. I have the link for you have the the the complete source for you underneath this slide. But I got for you just just for us to be on the same page
what I mean, or what the the the the author means when she talks about feminism. Okay? So she's gonna say that surveillance is a feminist problem. I mean, it is. It is a problem that those who are feminist should be concerned with.
So so before we move on. What? What is feminism so feminine? This word has many, many meanings, many, many meanings.
And but we could classify the meetings in 4 types or for like big meetings. Okay, there are many. But if we organize all those meetings into like, we could put like for boxes, so it means a a large body of theory about the nature of women's operation. So any kind of theory that's kind of
critiquing and analyzing Women's oppression could be called feminism. It is also a more political science kind of based theory that discusses, you know, practices that wants to liberate women from males exploitation. And here i'd like to make a caveat.
This I got this from the from the Sociology Dictionary for you folks. But again I I there is a consensus in today's world
that it's not only it's, it's it's much bigger than you know than liberate women than from May. You exploitation because I mean it's it's more like we don't, I mean, because here it feels like man is like voluntarily, clearly exploiting women, and that might not be always the case in society. Right so like people come to, we say, oh, I have brothers, I have it. They also they're also feminist. Yeah. So it's more like about patriarchy like this ideology that you know that man is stronger than men is wiser than men, you know. So just
I mean again, even though this is official, I mean, this is like not coming from the
man miserable. He can make men miserable because man got to be a superman right like it's almost like the men I mean in in you know, in traditional society man they have to provide. They have to do this. It's essentially. They have to be a superman and to be a superman. I imagine it might not be very easy. Right? So
exactly. Greer goes there. It's not man, but it is this hero, patriarchal society. Exactly right. So so look, and then, like another definition, is like a modern movement. It's more like social movement activism, you know, trying to change society, trying to improve the conditions of women. And again, I tend to see as more broader is not just the conditional women. But when we try to improve the conditional women. Necessarily we are by proxy. We are. We proved the condition of men, too, because, you know.
you know it's almost like you don't have to be that superman anymore if you are a man, and then also, another definition would be an ideology that opposes misogyny is t0 0r women hating ideas ideas that you know that promote hate behavior. Jessica, with you, please.
I was just wondering in terms of like surveillance states and whatnot. A lot of it was kind of based off, like the nuclear family and whatnot
do you think kind of in the reverse? Because I know feminism is usually about the feminine perspective, but
it does talk. How many have to be like the stronghold?
So is it almost like they tell men, or like male, identifying individuals of like.
Oh, you need to be big and tough and protect your family. We can help you protect your family. You need more security. You need more surveillance, so you can protect them.
So you You're asking me if if it is more like that? Is that what your question are you, don't?
Just if
kind of the idea of. Oh, you need to protect your family does fall into
like willingness to participate, participate in surveillance and like a surveillance state.
Yeah. So like it like a look. That's the thing here, I mean. Well.
first of all, here in Canada. Okay, Jessica, or in Western society. So when I say West Side, i'm talking about high income economies, because I mean Brazil is in the west side of the world, but it's a low income it's up. It's up mid mid- income economy, and it's a developing country. So i'm talking about the rich countries like Hindu countries, canada Western Europe us
So so in those societies usually the the feminist movement. They're going to say, Look, you don't have to protect yourself just because you're a man
I mean all the opposite. I mean you. You know you. You don't have to do anything because you are men right? So it goes like that. But in in some countries like I gave you the example of China in China, where the family is mobilized for a surveillance.
they actually reinforce. Pay turkey, and i'm going to give you more. I'm going to tell you more about China, but like by the idea is that me and I like to use China because it's like the opposite of what happens in here. So like when we analyze China, it's clear for us how our system works. But in China I mean, because surveillance is through the family happens through the family, and I discussed a little bit in one of my lectures. I mean, they reinforce
pay turkey. Okay, they reinforce pay tricky. Why? Because.
you know if you dissolve that idea. If you dissolve the idea of family, if you disappear with that idea of nuclear family, you know surveillance, I mean that this the the the Chinese government will lose their grip on the fam, on the on surveillance, because surveillance is embedded in your family. But here in the West surveillance is not so much is not much embedded in the family in the institution of family.
you know we don't really have that here. So here, you know it's it's surveillance is gonna show up more when the ways in which that you know the the May, the the the that that the female body is portrayed, and that data is gathered on the female by body. And the way in which that data is gathered about
you know the the May, your body, am I clear? I mean, do I make sense to you, Jessica? Your comments is really important, you know. Like.
Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you. Yeah, but come back because sometimes I know I mean again, we are going. I mean, this is oh, actual 100 level course. But I want to squeeze it and let's make it. You know again. The exam is easy, but I want you to think more about this stuff, right? So that's why I have a really crave and welcome your your feedback. Okay.
But so but be mind that looking can in Canada surveillance is not so much per pervasive inside of the family. It's not. It's not yet. Not yet, you know. So surveillance here impacts women and men in different ways. But it's not so much through the family. Okay.
okay, people. So keep that in mind. Okay. So what what we're talking about in terms of sort of a feminism?
So and then she's. So she goes back with this idea that surveillance is a feminist issue, and here he is. She says, surveillance often reproduce strict gender standards, including
those that are oppressive, right? And why do I have that picture behind here? Because it's a bunch of like containers. But actually, what I man with this picture is a bunch of boxes. So surveillance creates profiles like just like we. I discuss that in my lecture about the surveillance assemblage by Dr. Hagery, the one that I that I recorded from Vancouver for you guys. And I said, look the surveillance assemblage, this new concept to think about surveillance. It almost dissects us, and it transforms us into
data doubles
which is for files. Right? So we become little profile. So it's almost like you become your body, and you being a female body. It's going to be a body in a specific way. You being a a male body, you're going to be a body in a specific way. So say essentially, what's what this is going to is that like she's gonna try to show that surveillance is working a way that instead of liberating us
is actually
like it's almost like it's. It is like
it is like sending us waves of like, you know. Information like this is how you should look like this is how you should look like. So you know you look You look like if you're like me, I need to g0 0n a diet. I shouldn't be saying that because otherwise Google is gonna listen to me. And tomorrow i'm gonna have a lot of diet stuff. But I need to g0 0n a diet. So every time that I search I I've been even avoiding that actually, you know. But I I I've been I I did a couple of days ago. I did. I did Google some exercise.
like, you know, for for me to do, you know, at home. And then, all of a sudden, now, my Youtube, which dialogues with Google is packed with like diet stuff, and then like, and it's kind of it's kind of stormy me. That's the word that I was looking for so like surveillance the way it works. Because I did that search about being on a diet. Now I am being stormed with like all sorts of advertisements, and all in every single advertisement, there is a body in there
that is definitely not. My body is a woman like like, like in most case very, very fit, like like like, you know, it's the kind of body that perhaps i'll never have in my life, because I am too tall to have that kind of body. I am too large, like, you know, like when I am very faint. I'm still a big person, so you know, but like it's stormy me with like, you know. And then and all the sudden that tags along with like a hair products for for, and I don't even. I barely have hairs. You know what I mean like so it's almost like.
and I mean, thank God in my psychologist i'm very firm I mean when I say God like the universe, whatever planet I mean, who I am, my history, and in my psychologist, because I do have my psychologist, I am very firm and confident, and and well set in my identity, and in the kind of you know in my woman. But if I were not, I would start to kind of get. Second guess, like, you know, second thoughts about okay, am I? You know, you know, in in all, quite often with those
those advertisement. It comes like the like, some some types of woman, that that it's almost like
the way that they put it out there. It's all almost like, believe Believe it like it. It's almost like the it's trying to kind of
It's stereotyping women, and it's like you know. It puts women that I mean. I don't know how to say that in English, but it's like, you know. We know that it's disrespectful.
you know. So they put women in there and say, Don't, be this woman, and almost like as if
you know to be any kind of person would be a problem which is not right. We can be all sorts of people, but like the way that the advertisement works is like we put someone in there, you know, and say, don't be this woman be this other woman here, and for you to go from a to Z. All you need to do is like a 1,000, you know, set ups every day. I mean
you know what I mean. Like it. It's which for me is unattainable, and and I don't leave At first i'm happy with who I am. I want to just lose a little bit of weight, but it like all of a sudden, if you're not very comfortable with who you are, you start to kind of second guess, and that can get to you right I mean depending on your mind of state. And the same, I believe, goes for man, too, because I mean, if you Google oh, how do I need to hold my but some muscle all the sudden. You're gonna be like storm with all sorts of advertisements that you know. So the thing here is the portray. And then
in those advertisements what I see
is a very rigid gender standard. It goes back to kind of almost like patriarchy 200 years ago, you know. So it's it's very oppressive, almost.
Yes, exactly. And Jenna says the majority of these standards they are not attainable. They are not folks right? They are not attainable, right? So so
you know. So
anyways, I mean. So back in here. So so she says, okay, surveillance often reproduces strict gender standards any quite often, even when we look at gender standards for males males, they do have a little bit more of an upper hand
because they are male. They are the top of this call on so like they just they just go like. Okay, you know, I can have my long hair, whatever. Who is gonna challenge my manhood right like so. But we've been it. It it has almost like less leverage to discuss there to discuss that. I mean, that's not up to discussion. In any case, although the world is changing, and you look at me right now. I have short hair, right like, so so, anyways. But the point is how and that's where we would like to.
How surveillance is reproducing, you know, like stricter or strict gender standards. That's the point. How so? What she is gonna say? And here, people, i'll be honest with you.
I'm not very sure if I agree with the offer
again for the exam purposes, we're gonna go with the author. But I would like to kind of have a little discussion with you guys, you know, like, what did the argumentation that she gives to? How like to answer this? How here is that she's gonna Say, Look
now, we have a lot of.
I agree with her at that point. I see a lot of devices right now. We have devices that they count steps that they record your wait. Probably you guys have that stuff. I have some of that stuff here, my apple and my my iphone on my on my Chinese phone. I don't have an app like it. Might she? Me? You know my Chinese thing here so like, you know. So, monitor caloric intake, evaluate sleep, you know, checks your blood pressure, you know, like your good cause, levels medication records. If you took, or if you not take your
education, you know, or, you know, mood, relaxation, pregnancy, even sex life. And me. I because I do research with the Ontario police to you know, there they launch the health app for for public safety personnel, and i'm doing the evaluation of that app. So I mean, there's all sorts of app, you know, like, and I'm involved with them like personally, and from the research perspective. And I can't understand that now we are. Once you find the self, I can't understand that. And probably you guys agree
with that right? Because I mean you probably have a bunch of apps in there. So like when they all do surveillance on the body, and they quantify the body. They do exactly what Dr. Hager said in his article. The art that I presented last class, which is like it. It divides you. It's almost like I'm going to use here. Jessica. Jessica, you are not Jessica, you are! How many steps you took today. You are. You know how many your weight, how much you're losing your gaining. You are your you know how much you you
wait today. You know you are. You know how many hours is you slapped yesterday. You are your blood pressure. You are your medications. So it's like so many profiles of you, so many versions of you since that idea of the assembly of the Surveillance assembly. That is kind of chopping you and and breaking you into little, you know, pro like like flows of information and then assembling profiles right of you.
So
you guys get it right? So. But my question to you and the part that I really want to discuss with you. Here is
those apps
that they, those, like you know, apps tracking us.
Don't. They work the same for men and women.
This is a provocation Here, help me think this through.
because we have men and women being using count like step, like you know, things to count staff. So you have, like, you know, like a lot of the apps.
But and I and i'm pro walking, you guys, because you know better than I do, because those things they change every day, and usually the younger generations. They are more up to date to the technology they know overall. I know, you know, probably at the u of, you know, if I do a survey at the UV. I'm gonna 5, you know top 10 apps
that people use at the U. Of you know what I mean. Like it's kind of a group kind of thing. So what are the apps that are Very, I mean. You know that everybody's talking about them at the moment. And and how do they survey of men and women differently if they do so?
I see here, Selena, I think the worst thing about social media.
Oh, yeah, and that's the problem. I mean, I Yes, Selena, this quantification quantified itself.
It works for social media. And again, every single day we have kids youth dying from suicide or doing self harm, because
you know of of that, because that little flow of information doesn't really, you know, you know it's perceived in a way that shouldn't be perceived, or it's twisted, or you know, you know, you know, because you don't really match something, or because you don't really reach that target right like there's every single day. Someone is is dying because of that.
So Jenna goals. Some would work similarly. Similarly between men and women, but others made proportionally impact women. That's the argument of the
the the the offer, Jenna.
That's exactly the all the you know that goes back to Matthew's call, and to in your comment here. So that's exactly what she's saying. But the thing is that in the Archco she was very broad. She was like brushing all over, and she did not make. I wish what I would like to see was the analysis of one specific app
lock. Look at what this app does to women, and look at what this act does to men. I would like to see that if I was the person reviewing her article, I would give her this kind of feedback.
Okay, you want to write about that. This is a very important topic, but get more empirical. Tell me exactly how, because, like the example that she gave the pir go examples that she gave.
I couldn't really see I can. I can't imagine. But I I I would like to have something more concrete for me, and that's why I like. I'm asking you guys, because you probably you can come up with something that's happening to Sire, right now that I that I don't know.
Well, there is no guarantee on how they survey them. Yeah, exactly. I agree. There is no guarantee.
but
you know. But I what I see is that man. Are you also using those those things I like? Even perhaps I don't know, but maybe they're there. You know a lot of apps for the for the Mayo body as well controlling, you know, controlling somehow you know how many muscle. How much muscles you're putting, You know I don't know. I mean I, you guys, that's why you are more more upset than I am
in terms of health apps, and the apps work the same for both the genders.
But yeah, exactly, Matthew, that's the point, and she makes that point. The the gender norms. They are differently, and they and they work differently. But still I would like to see, because probably we do have. I mean in, and she says that they are for sure that we do need more research on that, because
I would like to see if, like inside of the app, if the the algorithm is being like, you know, for me and female. If it's been set differently.
you know. And obviously the whole point here is the social norm, right? That's why we are talking about feminism. You're very right. Dating sides. Bumble requires women to rechargement. Yeah, that's an example. That's a very good example. Okay.
That's a really good example. Someone else told me something else about the insights was my cousin, actually, but I forgot what was it but something like in that, you know that you know for that they the the they They're making a way, because they know that women are more put on to violence in dating like when they go meet someone I I can't remember which, she said. I'm actually go ask now after the class, so I I owe you 2 things. One is about the that
another one I'm gonna ask about the the app, you know, because I know that they are doing something. You know. I'm gonna ask my cousin what she told me, because she she's actually dating. So she's using those apps. So you know, she said something to me
size to identity information Exactly. Exactly. People exactly, because I mean, look all those apps. And the dating app perhaps, is a very nice example, because it it builds your identity. It's almost like you have t0 0kay, Who do you want to be? What kind of
what part of your identity do you want to port portray? You know in that profile that you're going to build in the dating app right? Like. So yeah, so that that that changes you. Okay, people, Why, people in this, and some people they just say all this part. I'm gonna hide this part of we would scroll right. So you you can manage
s0 0, sorry. I'm. Just see if there is one more comment here.
Also. Usually, if you get to like a step up for your phone to start with those recommend apps that type? Oh, yeah, you know, there's another example, Selena. Very good example. You see, there's like, i'm gonna bring this to class because we're gonna you know. So like those are the things I mean. We are here in this Class Day, like through your comments. We're we could rewrite her article and make it better like we've more in pure, quick examples, like, you know. The example, like Selena just gave, adding to what everybody just said. Yes, you know, because you buy one.
and then, all of a sudden you get advertisements for for something that you know, and that assumes that you need to lose weight, you know. So right. So you buy something, and this is not necessarily. Sometimes you're buying. You know that to count Step just because you have, you know, a hard problem, or because
you know, you just want to keep in shape, not because you want to lose weight necessary. But that provides you to that. It gives you that, you, you know.
So here's Matthew talking about the tools to reproduce gender. Not okay. I'm going to actually check. I am off social media people what? I'm gonna come back, and i'm gonna take a look. I'm gonna actually start with Tiktok because I do know, Instagram, I have had that in the past. But i'm gonna. I'd like to take a look at the tik talk, but i'm gonna to do exactly what you're saying so anyways. But the problem. Here
you have to keep in mind. That is not just so. It's almost like surveillance people. If you can take note of that surveillance is put, it's, put
it's it's been it's been serving gender norms. And Matthew said that, and he's right, and that is what is in the article, too. You know, so like surveillance is serving the norms that are out there. When the promise
it is quite often is that surveillance we will liberate you. But in the all, it happens the opposite. Okay, so it it doesn't liberate you. It it kind of reproduces what we are. The norms that we already have is sign. So look the apps according to the author, and I think that she's she's really good in what she says. Here.
You know the apps they feed.
You know the rationality of rentless, rentless self scrutiny.
scrutiny, you know. So it's. It's like. If there is this rationale that we are always always checking. Let me check my wait. Let me check by this. Let me check that. Let me check this. Let me check this other thing. So it's rentless self screw scrutiny.
So in this self scrutiny is a feature according to the offer
of a post modernist
kind of feminism. So it's like it's what she calls post feminism or feminist. So
per feminism. So here it actually should be feminism. And i'm going to change this here and re upload this slide.
But it's like so so actually. So there's this promise. We're going to liberate you surveillance. We're going to give you so much convenience and and safety and security. But you know No, that's not what's happening. It's just like, you know, like you know, we are being fed. The social Mars, and we are being asked
to a compliant to the social norms, and and this is creating. I mean, it gives us the feeling that is, it is liberating us. So it looks like some sort of feminism that helps both men and women. But in the end it is what she calls post feminism.
which is not really a good kind of feminism, or it's like I don't want to put in good or bad. It's not about being good or bad, but it's like it is a feminism, a type of feminism that doesn't really liberate, and then she becomes critical. Even though this author is a feminist author, she becomes critical of this new wave of feminism that doesn't really liberate, that is, actually reproduces not only gender norms, but also a now liberal kind of culture.
Okay, so like. So keep this in mind. So what to keep in mind. Surveillance reproduces the social norms, and to the point that anybody, however, it makes us believe that we're going to be liberated. Men and women, but in the end it does not. What it does to gender is that it's more oppression or a different kind of oppression, and that they offer calls that post feminism
with like new Liberal characteristics. Okay. So I know that my time, My, you know, I just have 2 more minutes. I'm gonna stop here in next class.
We're going to talk more about. You know this, this this idea of post feminism, which is a kind of feminism that she's criticizing, okay, criticizing
and and in and also a little bit about how this post feminism meets a new liberal kind of efforts or culture. Okay, so that's what we're gonna do. And then we do those slides that's missing, you know, and it's actually the bulk of the class. So we're going to be late a little bit, but it's fine we have. We're going to have. We're going to be able to catch up again.
So that's it for today. People so keep in mind, and your homework is watch surveillance this week until Thursday. Watch surveillance. Think about the apps. Think about all the apps that you use, and think about how they are one reproducing norms, and to how they are guiding feminine and masculine behavior in or or gender behavior doesn't have to be. You can be. But non binary how they are guiding gender in specific ways, you know different genders
in specific ways. So keep that in mind. Okay, so that's your job, please your homework. So thank you very much. you know, for for being here for showing up and really appreciate it. Thank you for your comments. And you guys have a very nice week until Thursday, and I see you live again on Thursday. Okay.
And I just just to remind you I do have off hours today in case you need to talk to me or you, wanna you know, just stop by whatever you need. I mean there, okay, i'm gonna just take some more coffee, and then i'll go back and open the link for off hours at 5 0'clock.

I don't think we have one.
So I would say that my level is kind of intermediate.
and and and i'm doing like a private lessons 3 h a week of French.
because my goal is to be able to teach in French, because French is very close to Portuguese. So like, especially like the Communologist sociology stuff is is like very, very similar. So so what I I actually d0 3
and and kind of intermediate kind of social level and Spanish and and all French.
So please call him ourselves your heart, You know. Taylor.
Yeah, it is a classification and identity. It is part of the Midterm.
Yeah, people. Yeah. But I don't want you guys Look, Trust me. Trust my experience.
If you guys lock yourself up in a room and you stay the whole weekend like you know, we felt having any rest.
This is this is not gonna work out so like the the the best way to do it. Do it a little bit every day, and if you didn't do anything because it's like you were too busy doing something else, you know now it's a time to make choices instead of kind of, you know. Lock up yourself.
because if you do, that is going to give you anxiety is going to make extremely tired, and might not even be effective. So you know, so kind of, you know. G0 0ver the material, and you know, Cove like this stuff that you kind of. Oh, I know this. I feel I know this better. Skip that, and go to the stuff that you don't know. You know

he taught someone that I know, and this person achieved proficiency really, really fast, and he's really good at teaching the verbs, so i'm paying him, and he's in Brazil. So that means that I don't pay when, after the conversion, it's kind of cheap. It's not too expensive, so i'd be like about
$250 per month to have like 3 h of French, you know, every week. So it's it's actually very, you know.
So anyways, people very nice. Seeing you guys, I don't want You guys stressed about the exam. So what i'm gonna do is a Saturday. I'm gonna work on on designing the exam, creating the questions. And then on Sunday, i'm gonna send you guys like a guideline.
you know. Oh, here's we're gonna have X number of questions from this article, you know. And again, at the questions you will be overlooked. But I will really like you guys to study, so you know, so you can have a nice mark, and then you don't have to worry so much about the final You guys get what i'm saying, I mean.
you know, because now you're used to have some energy. You know you have some energy in the tank to burn, but when you get to the end of the term you're just like dead right like super tired. S0 0kay, so let's get back in here. I'm going to start right now. So welcome, everybody.
Thank you for being here again. So we you were discussing very quick here. This is the article that we were discussing. Okay, we were discussing this article about.
I like like saying that surveillance is is is a feminist issue, and and indeed, it is because it concerns both gender. So it's feminists, not so much in the sense that concerns women only, but in the sense that it concerns gender. Okay. And and also we discussed here, and I remember that we had some very nice commons in the in the
to chat from Matthew, and als0 0ther people saying, Look, it's about the social norms. Yes, it is because people
I mean, you know, surveillance is. This is monitoring and data collection, and we will reproduce whatever norms we have in society. So if the norm is a side, is very patriarchal surveillance, we will be PE patriarchal if the norm is Sexist surveillance will be sexist. So so you have to keep that in mind. So it's like, you know. So for us to change surveillance, we need to change first the norm in society. Okay.
So
that was like the big take away from last class. And then we were like back to the text to the article like they offer was like, was using the example that, like surveillance, is gendered, and in the feminist issue, because, like it, has to do with like the the ways in which the technology classifies men and women.
It it kind of reproduces very strict, very rigid gender gender norms, right? So that that also is another. Take a take away from from last class, and and then the the offered. You know it talks about apps.
and but the thing is that. And we discussed that here also last class is that the you know, like the the offer is kind of my kind of broad. It doesn't really go into details. Okay, this specific app does that that? And here's how it's gendered. And then we carved together here in the chat. We kind of came up with examples right so like of like, you know you buy. I remember someone saying something very nice. I you know you buy a nap for steps, and all the sudden I mean there, Wasn't quite that the example. I can't remember exactly
what was the example. Perhaps you can even put that back in the chat, but you buy an app for, let's say steps. And then all of a sudden, they know you are women. You are a woman buying the app, and then all of a sudden. You get advertisements for something for diet, or you know. So it's like, you know it's gendered in that sense. But again, that has to be the Norm, that the norm is that if you are a woman you have to be, you have to have a specific body shape, right? So so, anyway, so like the author did not do a very good job at clarifying exactly
how that operates. But we broke a little bit here, you know, like that down that idea down, you know, like in our conversation through the chat. So
I stopped here last class and and and and I was telling you that you know the apps that we have in today's world.
This is gendered, I mean. And here kind of the author does a better job
like the author of our article. So the the apps that we have and think about all the apps that you have in your cell phone. So take a look at your cell phone. Now, you know, and look at your apps with some sort of critical kind of, you know, like, Stay away from them and look at them and and look at what they do think about what they do. So the apps like that that we all of us have. They? They feed this rationality
of rentless, rentless self scrutiny.
So it's out. We're always counting so it's there's this idea that you know that we are always kind of checking on ourselves. Right. It can be our weight, our blood pressure, how many steps, Whatever that is, our mental health
and our anxiety levels it can be anything. And and and we do that. I mean the whole narrative. The narrative behind those apps is that it's gonna liberate, you or you know, download this act. You're gonna have more steps, and that's gonna make you your heart better. So it's liberating because it's like it's gonna make you more like healthier. So you know, do this like relaxation app because it's gonna liberate you. It's gonna make you more relaxed and and grounded and and mindful, and
that's going to do it's going to good for you, so that, like every single app that we have out there today, the narrative is this: like
dice, chop yourself, transform yourself into flows of information, which is exactly what Yes, like what Dr. Hagerty said in his stacks about the as like the survey of assemblage, so like the apps they do that, they say, look, break, break yourself into flows.
and then, you know, we're gonna profile we when we're gonna help, we're gonna to you. We're gonna like, you know, organize you, and we're gonna make you feel better. So it liberates you.
but it does so in a way that you know that that encourages.
like self governance, self governance. This idea of self scrutiny is nothing more than just self governance. So you were governing your blood pressure, your body, your your. You know your everything I mean right so. And according to the author.
this kind of mentality mindset. It fosters a bad kind of
feminism.
The the author does not say bad kind of feminism. But if you read the article like you're gonna see that the the like in the second half of the article the author starts to kind of present a critique, a critic
of today's feminism, which is supposed to liberate men and women in in quite often does. But the author is gonna say it does it in a way that actually it it doesn't really liberate you. You know. You think that you are liberated.
but that's it. It it kind of, you know. It fosters that kind of self surveillance all the time. Right? So.
and that kind of self governance.
You know that that comes embedded with this new like feminism
he has to do. The author makes a connection which I find appropriate with new Liberalism. Okay, so let me take you there. So you understand what we're talking about. Look
so when we when we do. And this is the connection between, like the quantify itself.
and also the pull what the author calls post feminism, which it it's meanting there to liberate. Genders, you know, like this this connection, so like, let's see this connection, that of of post feminism.
this quantify itself and neoliberalism. Okay. So when we think about self tracking like the idea that you're gonna to track your whatever, and that's why I have this picture for you of someone tracking right like you know that idea.
It it is about it, kind of you know it comes together with the idea of up t0 0f self optimizing self improving. Oh, but we're so. Is there anything wrong with self improved? Of course not. I mean, of course, we all should improve our ourselves, but the thing is that it becomes like
a rentless.
It becomes even a source of anxiety for all of us, all of us. We want to improve our Gpas. We want to improve our everything. So it becomes this
like extremely tiring thing that never ends in life comes, boils down to that. It becomes all about that. I need to be better. I need success, success, success, success, success. And then you know, where is the end? Right so? And we're never happy, and that backfires eventually right so. But this mentality of success, and always kind of you know, improving it has, to, which comes together with like autonomy. The idea that I need to be autonomous I need to be.
I have a hard time with this word here entrepreneurial. So I need to always, you know, create new things. It's never ending. But that helps the economy
that creates like good justifications for the State, the Government to step away from helping us. It's like it's almost like Marcella, like the government tells me.
or the the Government tells us like all of us in this class. I have nothing to do with you guys.
I'm not gonna help you there's Covid. I don't care. There's whatever I don't care. You are unemployed. I don't care Why? Because it is your responsibility to you know, to like to do self surveillance on yourself, to self quantify yourself and t0 0ptimize yourself in a rentless way. So if you don't have a job that this is your problem, Don't, Mind.
this is because you did not book a job somewhere, so that it creates this kind of mentality which is the new liberal mentality where the individual is responsible for everything.
And and and in here it's nice like. If you see the second part here, this bullet point that I have, like the the governance of the individual, the governance that we absorb, and we project, and that becomes our way of self covering
in this. Within this governance it's almost like we are not responsible people. We become responsibleized people.
you know. So like I'm making this like the idea of responsible into a verb
like in English. Here we go from this responsible, which is a noun, and then it becomes like we have a verb. So it's. It's not about being responsible. It's about being all the time responsibleized by something.
Okay, so. And and and that can be, I mean, on the individual level, on the individual level that becomes a huge source of anxiety
and fear, because it's almost like I am alone. I have to do my Gpa. I have to get my admission to Mad school. Why, school whatever school I have to graduate and make money, and it's all me, and if I fail I mean
you know it. It it's because I fail. I am a loser right if I succeed.
it's almost like. If we succeed, whatever success means, we don't look back, and we consider the social forces behind our success, because again we never do it alone, we doing. We do it with the help of people
right like our parents. Usually, if you come from a stable family, your parents, They're helping you in this enterprise called Uva. You have professors, we're helping you. You have peers for helping you. You have circumstances that are. You know that are helping you somehow look even, you know, and and but we, when we succeed, we don't see
we don't see anything, any social force behind. All we see, is just like an Id. So there is maximization of I, right? So so
in surveillance
encourages that that mindset. So it's all about you. We classifies you. It monitors you, and it gives feedback on you right? So it's all about you. So surveillance puts you at the center right so, and and kind of you know, in in, in, in, in, in and in, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
surveillance also. Consider the social forces. Oh, you know, if Marcella comes from a low income family, therefore she lives in a low income neighbor. But this is all social forces I I did. I couldn't choose the family that I was born. Nobody can choose your family. If I could, I would have. I would be boring, you know there some royal family somewhere in Europe. But we cannot choose that we, you know. So so that's part of the social source for so surveillance force, so surveillance considers for that.
you know they see overall. It comes from this low income, low income family, and she lives in this low income area. Therefore, you know she's not gonna get that loan, or she's gonna get higher interest rates. But, however, I don't see I don't see that part of surveillance.
The parts that I see is just about me. Me, me I I I right so so, anyway, so like what the the the
surveillance.
It's quite often connected to this, like, you know, quantified of the self which pairs with new liberal mentality, which pairs well with the idea of liberation.
especially in gender, but that that doesn't really free you doesn't it does not really free you. So that's why he called that kind of feminism post feminism, and he associates with the idea of surveillance
being post-modern like and we cover that you know it. I I think wasn't the class that I recorded from Vancouver for you guys right that the idea that surveillance now we're calling it post modern because modernity it it doesn't like, sociologically speaking, it's from the social science perspective. Modernity does not have to do surveillance, surf it like more dirty, has with the with like anonymity
like you walking around in the CD. Nobody knows you, and surveillance is this new wave. It's post modern.
So that's why I know they offer calls post feminism. So this is not a very easy article to read, because it requires a lot of connections that some of you I think you have, but not it not everybody. This course might be coming from, you know, social science. So so, anyway. So if you have questions, ask away, okay here.
So she goes like, look
just to kind of break. I'm just breaking down for you. So the emergence of of post feminism, according to the author, you know, has to do with this this presumption, which is a neoliberal presumption that individuals are entrepreneurial. They're in.
They act in every sphere of life which is true to some extent.
because we we have choices over a lot of things, but there is a lot of things that we don't have choice, you know. So all of us here. You guys want to finish your school and find a very good job. But the thing is that you know there's no enough positions for everybody, so someone will.
You know someone good is going to be like with you for the job, and we tend to believe oh, no, no! That person is left without the job, because that person is not good. No people.
you know there is not. When you analyze labor statistics you'll see that there is just simply not enough good jobs for everybody, you know.
So, anyways, and here like so is what I put on this slide. The idea that I said earlier that you know that post feminism wants to liberate women, and also men admin to that. But in now, in an individual way, and people here there is, I don't know if there is anybody here who took
gender studies before. There is a little bit of a background here that I need to tell you.
The feminist movement, like as it started, you know, in the 50 S. 40 50 60 S.
If like, defend. This movement was very much like focused on on material things, and als0 0n the idea of social class, so social class like. If your upper class low class, like money
like, let's just talk about money like. So the feminist movement used to be very much
focused on money, on on pay inequality. Okay. So the women and men they got to be paid the same. I mean to this date it is, but it used to be much more strong, and and and the idea and all the analysis used to be very Marxist
for those of you who are in social science, or who has taken any course in sociology. You might have heard of Karl Marx. which is like one of the founding fathers of sociology, and he talks about capitalism, and how capitalism is organized, and it is all about money, the economy, so like those feminists from the 1950 60 S. They were very Marxist verification about classes, about money.
and now like this, and and but the this is context for each understand the article, because the actual author does not really bring that up for you.
And today, like the post feminism which is criticized by the offer in the article, you know. Doesn't really talk about money anymore. It's almost like the feminism. The feminist movements all over. Not only in Canada they don't read, you know, like gender pay is not so much their agenda anymore. Their agenda is much more like, you know. Like it's about it's. It's much more identity based
it's much more like, you know it's much more about like body, shape, oppression of the body, oppression of behaviors, not so much about the money, part of it. Okay, so. And and in that sense, so it it because it is very identity based. It tends to be very individualized.
and that's why you know kind of. But unfortunately the the the author, She does already make those connections for you in the text. So she expects that you're gonna kind of make those connections on your on your own, and that does not necessarily happen, because not everybody has that background right like. So so that's why i'm furnishing you with this extra information here. So when she says, like post feminist, wants to liberate men and women.
but an individual way, she's kind of referring to this identity, like politics within the fairness movement, you know, and and more specifically in here is like it, like the feminism of today which she calls post feminism.
you know, expect women to, that is, expect that women will work on their own liberation.
So there's like it's almost at this idea that someone is oppressing women. It's gone, and and it's more like, okay, it's it's all about yourself and about how you you know, Liberate yourself. And then she talks a little bit about apps. She says that some apps they do that job for you like they say, Look, you know.
you know, get this app in here because it's gonna. I think I even put that in the slides, You know she's gonna let me see if that is in here. Let me see. Oh, i'm good. Let me just skip a few slides, and then i'll come back to you.
Look, take a look at this last bullet point. Here
she talks about apps.
you know, and and and why apps? Because again, apps are about surveillance. They collect information right? So she talks about apps that they normalize women's distress.
and it's almost like, you know, and and i'm not. Look. Be careful because those apps they actually do Some calls to things for people
right? I mean it's very nice when a girl, you know. Oh, I can't do this, because you know I do it like a girl meaning like a girl. You know it's very nice, you know, to have like, you know, like you know, girls can do it, you know, like
you know, those kinds of encouragements, but I mean but again, but on this, on the other hand, I mean they kind of individual. They. They come in a very individualized way, and they come very detached from
like social class and the traditional, you know, agenda from feminism and and and but what is the problem? I mean with identity? Agendas? No, they are good, too. But the problem here is that they obscure agendas that are based on money.
and and it boils down that for us to survive. It boils down to money. I mean, we need money.
you know it's not just about identity, and you feeling liberated. However, you want to be in using apps to do so, but it's also about money, because it should be the money even to buy the app right. So
so, anyways, so let me just go back in here, and i'm just to the chat because I see someone commenting.
0 0kay, I have. Okay, you guys there.
So look
So here. So
according to the author post feminism sorts of undermined feminism. So feminism is no longer a perspective. You should be a perspective people for those of you who take who took a gender study. So you know you you now I am like oh, I know what Marcel is talking about. So you should be a perspective like a lens, a lens that you see the world
instead today. You know it has become much more like a subject of study. So people don't say any more. I am a feminist, and that's why I asked you less class when we start. Are you guys feminists, I mean, because it's it's kind of I mean in the university setting.
we quite see a lot of people still saying, oh, I am a feminist, but I am increasingly not only at the UV. But also elsewhere. I hear academics saying, i'm not. I mean, i'm not a feminist. I am an analyst of feminism.
or I am an analyst of gender, or I am a analyst of the post feminist culture.
you know. So I don't know if you guys noticed that. But like now we have more variations. And even in this class, like people are saying, oh, i'm a more kind of intersectional, so like, you know, there is this kind of you know. So when you say I am the intersectional feminist. Many of you said that I mean what you're doing. Actually you are transforming, and if you notice that, but like when you say I am an intersectional feminist, you are transforming feminism into a subject of analysis.
You're not kind of just putting on the jacket. No, i'm gonna go in there. No, you're kind of watching it, right? So.
And that has to do with according to the offer. With this idea of kind of you know
it has. It goes, boils back to this idea here of quantifying the self of analyzing the self. Okay, because if you don't, do some sort of quantification of the self
you are not capable of saying for you to be capable of saying, I am a a a a
intersectional feminist.
First, you need to be able to analyze yourself.
You get what I'm saying, I mean, which is, which is very good on one side, wonderful on on side, but but on the flip side it has to do for more. No liberal kind of understanding of the self
which he is. The lance that surveillance now looks us, collects data on us. right? So
so
to express this fluteness
or just fluidity, okay, so and and so essentially, feminism is losing its empirical value available a value. So before, like in the 1950 S. And seventies 8 is even, you know, feminism was like full of empirical things. It's gender pay, and this and that very fixed.
like agenda. Now, it's a fluid kind of
very much based on on J. On identity. Okay. So
so surveillance for the author in in forces both feminist, which, according to her, is this kind of
you know, Feminism, that that that we should be very aware of, mindful of, and even critical, of
how how does that happen by emphasizing the body as both a place of woman would.
and a site of women's value but myself isn't that good. Yeah, it has. It's good sign. Don't get me wrong. Okay.
you know he he has, I mean. But again, but he individualizes people right. So it it like the app, the idea of an app that counts your steps. It individualizes you
ready caters to you as an individual. It doesn't really speak to your condition of being a woman. Okay. like you, you know, the same goes for calorie intake apps and any kind of app.
and even like the advertisements that come together with that, you know it individualizes you. Right so.
And the idea, the whole idea of this new feminism.
which is which is embedded in surveillance is pleasing
the self.
So it it doesn't really, you know there's no collective agenda here. It's about you. It's all you know. I need to lose weight, and then i'm going to be happy, and that's it, you know. So
you know it. It wishes for like to like like like this new feminism, and and to get her surveillance it wishes for Portray as a women, you know. Oh, here have to fix it. We separate for wishes for portrayals of women
that involves being active. It's a that here, instead of now, that involves being active being, you know, some sort of desiring sexual object, so that continues
so that that you know that Norm. Well, you know. Well, it's it's you know it's like well before women like you should be very, I mean, seen, seen, portrayed as passive, right like oh, even our passive and and they are the object
object of of sexualization.
But now it's like you know it's the it flipped like it just flipped the sign from plus to mine, but it didn't really change much so, but like you know, we've been now, it's portrayed as active like. Even the idea of an app is like, you know, if you need an app.
that it's gonna count your you know steps because you're active. If it's gonna you know, count your sexual life. It's because you know you're active, but like you, you know. But it's it, and it treats you. You're active now as a woman, but you know you and you are. You are a subject of sexual desire.
but so you are no longer that object. You become a subject, but but still I mean it's almost like a change, but it doesn't change much. So you are still kind of before I was okay. I want to be beautiful according to the Standard, because I want people to want me.
you know. And now I want my husband because you should be very homosexual, right. So you know I want to be beautiful because I want my husband to want me now. He's like No, I want to be beautiful because I want
I want someone.
So it flipped, but it's the same. The norm is there pressurizing you to be beautiful, that specific standard, you know, if you are a woman, so let me just see the you know
exactly, Anita. That's the consequence. The consequence is this rentless source of anxiety? Because again, before I need to be beautiful and I'm going to work out there. There's no apps.
you know, and i'm gonna work out because I want my husband and and i'm desperate, because, you know i'm. I'm very concerned. You know that if my husband doesn't like me, he might cheat me. This is like traditional patriarchal society, and know. And now you know. And now it's the opposite. No, I wanna work out, and I even have the Surveillance Act. That's gonna help me because I wanna
I want to dominate. I want to go in there and get the person that I want. So this.
But still the anxiety. Is there? Am I beautiful?
Right so? And then I question man, too. Am I? Do I have muscle enough muscle? Do I have the perfect back body. Right? So
yeah, exactly, you guys got it. So it goes back to that idea that the norm did not change
right like that, Matthew. And some people put them to chat less class. The norm did not change. So look the apps and and the kind of surveillance that we collect, and the advertisement that comes with those apps. They call for resilience.
They call for us to be strong and resilient for us to be happy for us, to have great for us to have confidence.
I'm not gonna go in there riot for anybody. I'm not gonna have that sense of belonging that you know that other women are suffering, or other men are suffering because they don't have the body that they want, or because they don't they are not making the men the money, or you know I mean, you know we're not going to have that. It's going to be all about me.
It comes that I ideology again. It's me and and I I see no part of me from all happy with me.
I mean i'm not going to care about others. which is very new, liberal right like.
and in normalize the distress right? Which is nice again. It's nice, but it has a flip side to. As I I said earlier, so look so essentially. Women continue to be in man, too.
Because again, when I talk about women, I like it is to to choose genders. Because again.
what the women. What a woman is
sort of defines! What a man! What a man is! So if a woman is this, you know it defines what the man is, you know, like those 2 things.
they come in relation, right? It's very. We usually think about women, but I mean, but like those 2 things, they are together because those gender standards they are but pretty much in all position, like the idea of women
societal, not not the idea that I defend, or that you may defend or support. But in society the idea of woman of a of a female is the opposite of a male right. It comes no position. So that's why we always got to think about them together. So, like, you know, essentially women, they continue to be subject
to particular kinds of observation and scrutiny in popular culture.
So this piece here, I mean this, will remember this offer. She's in Media stays so she said, to be like more. She's like navigating on the theoretical kind of level. You know, she's like it's some so, and that's a little bit of a problem sometimes, because I mean when they do critical, like sociology or critical criminology, which is the case here sometimes like. Sometimes they lose like the empirical evidence. That's why I heard in particular. Examples are not as good, you know.
but anyways. But so you know. So we have. We have trolling, you know. We continue to have trolling on the Internet, and we continue to have
horizontal surveillance all the time, right? So in in as well as self surveillance, so like horizontal surveillance, just like mutual surveillance people, you know, like women and men doing neutral surveillance on, on, on their bodies and and their identities. So people
I would like to share with you.
because when I was coincidentally, when I was like reading the article for us to discuss.
I and preparing discussion here to class, I came across actually someone sent to me this
this like this: this came from the the the British newspaper called the Guardian. Okay, it's a. It's a British newspaper that if you follow whatever is going on in the Uk. But anyways, but I saw this, and I found very interesting. I mean, this is about Google
targeting low income. Us women with ads for Empire abortion. Okay. So like. So whenever women
the search on Google like, oh, you know, abortion, let's suppose you know I I need an abortion service. I and I go in on Google and I search that, and I am in the United States.
If if if I am low class
a bunch of you know, a bunch of advertisements against abortion. We'll pop up
and and also clinics that they call clinic for abortion crisis, meaning, oh, I wanna have like, you know. I want to have an abortion. But then, like I go to this clinic.
they they would like the those clinics they deem my situation like me, wanting to have an abortion as a crisis abortion crisis. And then you know the the advertisements. They invite me to go in there and and have a consultation whatever that would count me down.
you know.
as if I was some sort of mad person.
and you know, and it would call me down in in in, in, convince me to not do an abortion. But what's interesting about this is that it's targeting low income women, and in the United States low income women. Usually there's an overlap. Also, we feel like caller, right? So it's usually Hispanic
or Latin, a max of people and and black folks right? So so, anyway. So there's a racial component to this. And and obviously I mean, so this is the work of surveillance, because I mean. Google knows exactly who we are through surveillance.
and then it's targeting us. And then, like e, if you read the article, I mean, if I if You're curious. You want to read my I, and not for the exam, but me to say I recommend you. Take a look at it, because I found it very, very interesting. So
Google denies doing that.
and they say that they don't target. But again they don't open the algorithms. We don't know exactly how they do you know their searches? I mean all of that is part of their business secret so, but they deny which, of course, is is Bs right. It's not even Bs is what what what I call buffalo s
it's so big the Ds is so big that I call it buffalo, as you know. So so anyways, let me just see what you guys have here.
Yeah, exactly, Grier. That's exactly that. It's toxic.
Yeah. So we have to be careful now in like be bit. Now that I mean you are taking this class, Be very aware of the apps that you guys are are using are consuming. You know not that you're not gonna have apps. I mean, we all. It's very hard to leave a life without an app.
but be mindful of what they are doing to you, and how they are, what kind of stuff they are selling to you, and they like
shoving it down your throat. You know people are critical. And here we have Kira. This is reminds me of the concept of the meal gaze.
how we are portrayed and viewed through a certain line in a certain light in in their eyes, and we, and not only their eyes, but also in the eyes of women, right? Because I mean that male gaze quite often gets transposed to women I've seen. I have. France will be.
They talk as if they they use that mail gaze. You know they they critique, others other women using the Mayo gaze right? So. And see here.
Oh, I have something that oh, and we continue to uphold this ideas.
Yeah.
yeah. And yeah, exactly, that's that's the purpose. I mean, in the end we believe that we are alone, and we kind of go alone, right? But we are not. And and the surveillance does that to us because surveillance individualizes people
just like go going back to Haggard's piece the one that I discuss from in Vancouver, I mean, surveillance individualizes us. So we we don't. We think that we are the only one in the world going through that, right? Like.
Okay. So I think. Let's see here what else I have, and I would like to finish this class.
since we are in a mode of kind of
doing a critique of what the authors called post Modern Feminism, or post feminism. I would like to remind you, i'm gonna go back to the traditional feminism here and talk a little bit. All money
I got this for you. This is from statistics, Canada, 2,020. This is just the average
after tax income in that meeting, and I got it for we women 35 t0 44. I know that you guys are not in there yet.
You are just starting your life.
But the thing is that I took this like 35 t0 44 years of age.
because
that's when the disparity in in in in money, in a quality gender pay inequality gets really becomes a crocodile kind of mouth.
Why? Because that's when 35 t0 44, it's when we when they have they get pregnant
and then you know, with their partners they make the decision that they will stop working, or
It's the time when women go into part time positions because
again because of child, child care. Right so so in here you see how big the you know the so this is the the tipping point when I mean when you are young at your age.
and I can send this information to you. Oh, actually, I forgot to get the information from the Central Bank for you guys, i'll get it, you know, for that.
But anyways
i'll I'll go get this information for you next class.
But when you are young there is a disparity.
but it's not so big, and and I don't have it on the top of my head right now. But I I actually saw it's just like a 5 0r some, you know, $1,000. We just do a lot for you guys right like if you think that your classmate 6 sitting next to you, if that person it belongs to the you know, to the, to the muscular in gender, I mean, if the person's a man, they identifies as men. Or even if the is sex, like from the sex perspective, biological perspective, I mean a man in and follows whatever
society considers. You know the the Mayo standard. That person is making, like, you know, 5 6 7 $5000 more than you, even though you guys are the same. You have the same job sort of the same job You are going through the same degree, right like.
And then when you get t0 35 44, it gets much bigger. So this is the annual annualized. Okay. So if you're a woman, expect to make 40, not almost $50,000. But if you are a man. You're gonna be making 60,
you know, and plus a $1,000. This is the average. So this is statistics. Canada. If you want to see
you can go in there. I think I provided the source underneath. I'm not sure but you can just check statistics, Canada stuff like the senses, or even like annual data, and you're gonna see you can see the medium True, You can see the Mac like the
the median, and you can see, you know, the first second quartile, and you can see all the statistics in there.
So and here, people. Oh, yeah, this is 35 I also bought 25 to, you know. Look at this s0 30 35 t0 44, and I also forgot. I also bought 2534 which is your your your kind of with your age. Well, you're not. Maybe you're not 25 yet, but you know. Look at this, you know. So
okay, and this is going to be even bigger.
So and here I. This this is not as new.
This is old statistics from it was published in 2,020, I think, published.
But this the data is from much earlier, because it takes some some statistics like this one. It takes whatever to to get published. But the point here that I like you to see is that oh, shoot!
This is like disturbing me. I can't see, you guys, because I I see hold of them. Just try to see this slide, because I can't see this line.
Well, I can't really see this slide, because I can't move the chat. But anyways. But what you see here like is that you see the amount. I don't know if the green is the amount. Okay, let me just give you a second, because I need to.
I'll need to move this somehow around. Okay, Got it.
So look, green is the amount of unpaid work
that people do in their household. Okay, unpaid, meaning chores, you know, picking up kids in school, you know, laundry cooking, you know, like that kind of stuff.
and the blue is paid work the stuff that actually gives you money, and then you've seen there that you know, for you know, like you see, for men and women like, you know.
Let's take a look at 2,015, which is on the left side left side. So look at this, you know. So, man, they tend to do more paid work, and even less, and but women tend to do more unpaid work. They both work about the same effect.
We've been work a little bit more than men on a weekly basis. Okay, so like, you know, women work more than men in terms of hours on a weekly basis. But oh, sorry
on a daily basis. Okay, this is daily basis. So women works like more than men on daily basis. But the chunk of unpaid work is bigger for women to meaning that They work a lot, but they don't make money, you know, because they are doing other kinds of work on paid work.
and then but look, but the situation is not so tragic. If you compare 2,010, which is on the right hand side of the graph.
and you compare the left hand side. You're gonna see that the situation improved. We've been used to work many more hours per day, and you should be a to do a even bigger chunk or a bigger, you know, chunk of of unpaid work. Okay, Which doesn't give any money, but it's equally important, right? So anyways, I put this in here just to kind of
invite you. I mean again, feminine in today's world became very much about identity. But but here's just my personal invitation for you to mind money because inequality is still in there. Okay, people.
So let me just stop sharing
and start the next Powerpoint slide that I have.
Does it make sense. People. Do you have comments? Anything you want to add?
Folks, are you guys there?
They're not sleeping. Are you?
Okay?
He is there, and Grace is there. Keep you board here.
Good. Okay. Thank you very much. So look, let's go. Let's do. Now, today's slide.
Okay, let me just share again.
Hey, folks you're supposed to be to have what you're supposed to see me and my next set of next set of slides and just get some water here.
Okay.
Okay. So today we're going to start a new kind of chapter in this course, and we're going to talk about classification and identity.
And why we're talk, even talking about that. We need to kind of go a little bit deeper into that into the idea of classification. Because, again, surveillance is about monitoring. It's about data collection and surveillance
uses information to classify people to profile people. So that's why you know, we go a little bit deeper into yeah, and this will be. This will be in the midterm. Okay, this will be.
and just to kind of make things easier for you guys, I mean, I I will. I will continue to talk about this topic next week on on Tuesday.
But just to make things a little bit easier because I don't want to. So I Everyone you guys do well in this exam. And I know some people are already like very stressed about it. So I don't want you guys to be stressed. So i'm gonna i'm gonna. We are supposed to have sure.
Well, they should be 3.
Our readings for this chapter. Okay.
If you see the syllables I have like if you're going to syllabus right now, you're gonna see that, you know, under this class classification and identity. You're gonna see that I had like something a red like Tbd. To be defined. I was like, maybe some vide0 0r or reading.
so i'm supposed to have 3 things, but for the exam.
I'm gonna stop at today's class. So that's gonna make it easier for you guys. Okay. So for today's for for next week's Exam: on the sixteenth.
I am going to stop at today's class, so whatever I cover on
on Tuesday.
it's not going to be on the exam. That's going to give you guys a little bit of, you know. kind of time to breathe. Okay.
Is that okay? Do you understand me? So you are supposed to read
like today's article, but that will be on the exam, but not the other stuff that we're going to cover afterwards. Okay. So this is going to be our cutting point. So then, you guys are more kind of okay.
You're not so stressed, I mean. And and this article is is fairly easy, and i'm not even I'm not even gonna cover the entire thing now, because I won't have time. So you know, i'll tell you i'll tell you like at the end of this class. I'm gonna tell you where you're going to stop. Which Page: okay. So let's let's go people.
Okay. So look.
this is the article that i'm talking about. It's called identity, surveillance and modernity.
Marcella is isn't that supposed to be post modern modernity post modernity, because you know, you told us a surveillance is something that's it's long in what sociology calls a postmoder society. Yes, but you know, for whatever reason this
offer here, Richard hits side to keep it. Modernity, you know so. And then so identity, surveillance, and modernity sorting out Who's who?
And this is in the Root Ledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies, which was
edit by Kevin Heggery. Okay, our pro here at the UV.
And today i'm going to do part one of this reading. So let's let's go cover that. So look, this is the book where you find, you know this article, and you can see here, I mean, I know this quote is on very clear, but it can see Christy Ball.
this person, Christie. She's all she's, you know. She's a a professor at I think it's in Juba Universal Inebra. I can't remember exactly where she is, but she's great people. She's fantastic.
She study surveillance in the labor movement. Okay. How employers do surveillance on the employees. It's she's amazing. I mean, she's like really good.
And then Dr. Hagerty Kevin here from the of that you that the person was supposed to teach this course, and David Lyon, who is his best friend. They are very good friends, Kevin and David Lyon. Okay. And this is Richard
Jenkins. Okay, so this is the guy, and he is who who wrote the article today, and he is at a university here University of Shenfield, in the Uk. I think it's Liverpool, if I remember correctly. So he's in Liverpool, in the Uk: okay.
I have. I really like I. Personally. I really enjoy this reading.
and I would like to share something here with you. It was this reading when I read this this reading that you guys are are supposed to read.
that I I realized. Oh, man, I really like surveillance studies.
and I want to do my Phd. About surveillance in China, and I want to do it with Kevin Hegery. I want Kevin to be my adviser to be my supervisor. So it was like when I read this piece that I was like, oh, man! And I got a lot of insights from this piece.
you know. So this is for me Personally, I I did not I again. This. This piece was chosen by hagery for this course, but when I saw it like oh, I love this piece, and it for me so meaningful, and I hope that you enjoy reading it, and a. And what I like about it is that it talks about
like you know it kind of
it. It just kind of, you know. It makes you kind of see surveillance, because we can to a aphasize too much. In my personal opinion, the technological side of surveillance, and we tend to forget what surveillance does.
And this piece does exactly that you know so kind of. You know. It kind of theorizes a little bit on the importance of surveillance, and Why, it's important for human beings, you know.
So, anyways, so, people the first idea here, and this is a very simple idea.
but it can. You can get very complex if you start to think a little bit about it, I mean if you brush over it's simple. But you actually take your time to think about it, it gets really complex. So identity. This is the idea. Identity is relational. Okay.
So identity our identity. My identity. The first thing is that this is a very complex thing. If I ask if I ask someone here, you know one of you to explain to me your identity.
I mean, if you. If you take my questions seriously, it might take you like a whole day, and and that will not be enough. And actually.
it's a very hard question to answer It's the question: Who are you
right? Like? Who are you? I mean. We are so many things that we know and that we are aware of, and we are so many things that we don't know that we are, and that we are not even aware that we are. And on top of that
our identity keeps changing.
So you know what I am keeps changing. What I know that I am, keeps changing. My knowledge of myself keeps changing. How I interpret myself keeps changing. So it's it's a very relational thing. I mean entity. The idea of of of sort of a identity. It's extremely relational, and so it has to do with me
just me, and and how I see me, and how I see myself in the mirror. That's why I put a mirror there for you, and also you have to do how people see me.
Right? So so it's not just about me. It's about how i'm seeing. So it's a very, very complex concept, this concept of identity. Right? So and again it it. This is obvious. But if you actually start to think about who you are, and I invite you to do that. Think about yourself who you are.
You're gonna see it so it's very hard to to describe, to say to answer that question, and in most cases we spend our whole life trying to understand who we are. Right, like. So
in sociology, okay, and sociology is the bases of surveillance studies
we like, You know, there is this idea that we viewed. Look, Look at, Read here on the side we build our identity based on a reflection of how we think
we think
we appear t0 0thers.
It's crazy like it. You know a lot of my identity is about. Let's suppose that I am this person here in blue shirt, and and a lot of who I am is is what I think
that this other people in here
what I think that they think of me. So it's almost like a little bit neurotic like it's what I think
that Grace or Matthew or Greer thinks of me.
but it's not really what they think is what I think that they think
right. So it's like it, kind of you know. So think about.
You know people, you know, dying from suicide. You know people who are depressed, you know, because I mean it's social media especially.
It has to do with like, you know. Oh, you know, I post this picture. But Grier did not like my picture, so I think it agree. It doesn't really like me, and that means that, you know, and that you know so like in in in in surveillance, Foster, that a lot
surveillance through this, like, you know, for for social media platforms and likes and dislikes, and all like the advertising. I mean, it's all about that is about like trying to go for surveillance tries to govern and to govern. You know
identity
right? Because it's about like, okay, what you know. It's trying to govern what I think that she thinks or they think of me.
and therefore what I think of me, it's crazy. I mean, it governs that. So it's extremely powerful right? So so in sociology this concept of you know my identity being based on a reflection of of what I think the other people think of me.
It's called Looking Glass Self.
This is not in the article.
but I will ask them the exam. Okay. So how this? You know, i'm going to put the sentence in the exam. This something like that. Express what I have here on the slide, and i'm gonna ask, how is that been labeled in sociology?
You know, in service studies? It is looking glass self. Okay.
this is a very old concept to sociology that came around in 1,910 like more than a 100 years ago, but it's too very valid, and and and that's exactly what surveillance governs the sense of identity more specifically. The governance. This looking glass self like the idea that you know what I think that others other people think
of me. Right? So
So people
identity identity. It is something that happens
through interactions.
So we need interactions. So it's not just again. It's not just about me looking at this mirror and thinking whatever I think about me. No, it is about the interaction here in the group also.
you know. So and and and through within our interactions we develop roles, all of us. We play roles in society.
right? So you want to be that best student. You want to find that job. You want to achieve success. You want to be seen as a successful person. You want to be a doctor. That's a role you want to be, You know. You want to be a worker. You want to be an employee of a large company, and you want to be well paid. You want to belong to a per class. Those are all roles that you play in society.
right? All roles
it is, it is Valen. And this is stage theory as well. Okay, like this idea.
like the stage theory, the it comes from those ideas from the beginning of the century. Okay, beginning of the century. So and there's a lot of sociology. But
in psychology. But around the idea of like that identity is relational, a lot a lot, you know. So so for those of you in psychology, what i'm saying here is obvious. For those of you who took a sociology should be office to you as well for those of you who are not from like psychology and not from sociology. Then perhaps it might be some sort of novelty for you. Okay.
Otherwise it's not going to be. An
so, you know you see me
even before you come to this class. To this course you knew that you would meet a Prof.
And in your mind you had expectations, right? Because you expect. Okay, you say, look. The role of a prof
means that you know the person should dress and behave in a specific way. The person should do certain things. So you know I can actually call that person a Prof. Otherwise I I won't right so.
and the same goes for a doctor, for a mother, for a father. So we all you know we we, you know we have. You know there's expectations around roles right so, and those roles. They feed back our identity, and they are part of our identity, right? So so right now, just give you a mini course on identity. Okay. So we're. So how about surveillance? Okay, Look classification, because I mean, after all, the whole
thing here is about. Look, where is the it's about identity? It's about surveillance and about
identity. So look, people. Now, let's talk about classification.
which is exactly what surveillance does. Surveillance classifies surveillance technologies through data collection and monitoring surveillance class technologies. They classify you they produce profiles
so. But before we talk about surveillance, let's just take a moment to think about classification.
See with me here
we
in our lives, in our daily lives.
We are constantly looking for queues and similarities, so we can classify.
we can classify the other person. We can classify professors. All this is a good Professor, this is a bad professor. This is, you know, a nice professor. This is a mean professor. This is a nice classmate. This is a you know, a caring classmate. You know this is a good school. I will apply for that school because it is a good school. This is a bad school. I'm not gonna find there. This is a nice employer. I'm gonna i'm gonna try to work for that person or that company, You know. This is not this: this. This food is good. I'm gonna buy this food because it's good.
This other food is not good. Therefore i'm not going to buy it. So what we do
in our lives daily. We classify
Okay, so we we do surveillance all the time because we are always we. We we are constantly monitoring and the to find things and monitoring things and gathering information about things so essentially here. The idea, Valence, I'll get to you in a second
the the you know to that chat. Essentially, the idea here is that we classified the world.
And but more than that, the idea here is that to classify something is human.
Okay. So people.
now is the time you're gonna tell me. But, Marcella, I have learned.
I have ours. I have our thoughts that profiling something or someone is a bad thing.
Not necessarily. not necessarily. The problem is not the profiling itself. The problem is how we do it. and what kind of ideas we attach
to whatever thing that we are profiling.
So that's the problem. But of finding or because profiling is classifying to classify something as human. It's actually people part. You know it. It it's it's it's part of even our brain the way that our brain works. I don't know if we have anybody here in science.
But you know science, one on one bring, you know, one on 1 0ne of the things that you learn is that it's just like our brain has this enormous. It processes data through classification.
We organize things right, like, you know, we put things. Our brain puts things in like in drawers or in, You know, boxes in, you know. That's how we process
right? So and and so. This ability to process and to classify things classify the world.
This is what makes us humans animals. They do have that, you know. We can teach animals to classify things, too. We can teach a dog to say, Look, this is the smell of a cocaine.
I I even had like a cartoon of a dog a while back in my E class, you know, like the dog, saying, oh, i'm getting addicted to this smell so we can teach dogs to classify the world, to classify drugs for us. We can teach birds things. We can teach animals.
but it it's something that they don't really do it. I mean, they just some extent. Yeah, they do it, but it's their ability to classify is very primitive in comparison t0 0urs as humans. Right? So
exactly, Jessica goes in there. It makes easier to process. Yes, because you imagine people, if you don't classify stuff.
how do you process? And here Valencia says it's safe
to say that we judge someone's role in identity more strongly If they are some one of a higher status. Look, it is safe to say that, Valencia, because we are taught so.
and that's the problem, people.
That's the pro. I told you the problem is not to classify per se. because that's natural. I mean, that's biological.
But the problem is how we are taught to classify.
So if you come from a racist family like I came. I came from a racist family. and I will start
like not like. Not that my mom gave me a lecture. No, it was very subtle.
very, very, very subtle. you know.
But I was like, I learned that you know that to be black was not okay.
I come from Brazil, an extremely racist society.
and obviously, you know, I mean, I learned, and I I put you all signed up that in quality, but that wasn't that that I was born. How do I know that my mom tells me this tells me a story that i'd like to share with you. She tells me story that I was like 4 0r 5 years old. Look! 4 0r 5 years old.
Kids are not racist right like your parents are, and then that stuff get ingrained in the kids through socialization.
No.
you know. So my day. My mom tells the story that I was like, you know, 4 0r 5 years old, and I went to school.
and then like for the like, you know, like for the first time, and then I came back home, and my mom was driving me back, and in my month told me that I was very ashamed. I was kind of awkward in the car.
and as if I had done something wrong. And then my mom was like, okay, how was your You know how was your day? And then I said, oh, I made I may. I met I met so and so and so it's going to be my best friend.
And then my mom. Oh, yeah, this is nice. And then my mom noticed that there was something awkward happening.
and then she asked me more about this friend, and then I felt duty, and I was. I mean, this is my interpretation of me. But I I can't obviously cannot remember this, and this is like I am reinterpreting the story based on what my mom told me. Right so. And then my. And then I said, yeah, tell me more about your friend. I said, yeah, mom.
This is like she's great. She's fantastic. And then my mom kind of look at me, and then I was like, oh, yeah, she's Black Mom. but she's great. She's fantastic she's. I really love her like you Imagine a kid saying that I mean, if a kid says that
that speaks back to how racist the parents are. You get the point? I mean. So, anyways, I am saying this because I mean, we learn those things. So that goes back to you like Valencia's question, I mean.
is it okay? You know, I mean to to classify is okay. But the problem is how we classify people and what kind of attributes we attach to them, and a lot of what we do is societal and individual as well, because you know it's how you you choose to be. Sometimes you you may choose to. Now we see people that they there's an all a lot of knowledge about Nazis like Jewish who died, were killed, assassinated by by by Hitler and his government, but a lot of people. They choose not to learn that knowledge. They
They choose to believe that that all is fake news, and they choose to deny that that is a reality, even though there's a lot of Jewish people who are still alive to this date. A lot of like, you know. Empirical evidence, concrete super concrete evidence of of the holocaust. But people choose to deny. So it is like, you know.
So the problem is not. The classification is the social norms again.
and how we and also us how we choose to behave in this world.
Right? So yeah, and and quite often, sometimes people going going to what Jessica is saying. Sometimes we.
although we have this very powerful machine called human brain sitting on top of our neck. Sometimes we chose, we choose to go down the easier way.
We just, we just go with the flow.
and quite often we we discriminate. We reproduce discrimination because we choose to go with the flow when we choose to do whatever is easier, we choose not to d0 0ur research right? So that's the problem. But anyways, back in here people
sorry.
Why do we classify why we classify to produce knowledge? So that's how we that's how our brain produces knowledge.
It's for it's it's it's, you know it's through classification. So we produce knowledge, knowledge on everything. and why why classifications is like Why, that classification is important, not only because we produce knowledge, but because the knowledge that we produce gives us a sense of stability. It gives us a sense of safety.
Okay, so it's almost like to live to live life, to live in a society. It can be very dangerous. That's why I have lions kind of running after you here. Let's pretend that those are lions, and that they are chasing you so to little society is very. Is that easy?
Come on, think about. You know the rejections that we get. You know the the school that we wanted to go. We didn't go to. You know the course that we want to take, but we can't take, because it's full. Think about. You know someone that we lost, but that person doesn't allow us back. Think about the job that we want, but we can get think about. You know the the things that you want to have, but you don't have the money to buy, so I mean to leave this aside is not easy.
and if you go back to thousands of years ago, I mean now we have this very kind of comfortable society for a lot of people, not for everybody. A lot of people in poverty. They that they don't get our level of comfort, but like, think about back, like, you know, hundreds of years ago.
like we actually had to chase our food. We we, we we have to kill and eat right like we had to queue up to eat we had to kill, so I mean, so like to live in society, is not. It's not easy and to live. Life is not easy. So you know that classification gives us knowledge. We provides us stability and a sense of
safety. Right? So
so here, people I like, I know that I cook. I still have like 8 min. I'd like to cover 3 ideas.
That's where i'm going to stop. I'm going to cover 3 ideas
that they are right in the beginning of the article. Okay, so the the the offer says this before we talk about surveillance, we really need to understand identity. And that's why I'm taking the time here to explain identity and identity formation for you guys. So you guys can. Okay.
you know, be in the classification, because it's all about. I mean, you know identity is a result of classification for you to identify any, to classify right? So not on yourself, but others. So look at this.
I'd like to give you those 3 ideas that they are very important for you to make sense of what's going to come later. especially the Surveillance park. So identity people here is the you know, the the the like. The idea Number one.
Identity is a process, I think, by now it's clear for you. Okay. So it's not something that we have.
So identity is not the spray that I can actually grab and have it and put in my purse. No identity is a movement is a process.
Okay?
So it's so that's why a lot of people. Oh, I I like recently. I know a professor somewhere not any of a friend of mine somewhere else here in Canada, and I met him in Vancouver, and he told me, Marcella, I I would like to share something with you. It's like, oh, share away! And then and then he told me, oh, you know I am gay.
and he was having a hard time to deal with it. And again, this is about this is just to kind of a very, very basic basic example. Just to show you how you know I mean it's a process
right? So he was not game before now. He's gay, I mean his identity changed right? So it's it's not something that you have. It keeps changing right, or it doesn't mean that. No, i'm not saying that people are going to change their sexual sexual sexuality. No, it can be other things right. So identity change over time.
and we should use the word we don't. But ideally we should use the word identification instead of identity.
They're both now in English like identity, and and and identification is unknown. But identification gives the idea of a process right like there's a process behind, but we don't instead. We use identity right? So
here we have Jessica asking: do you think that self surveillance are so successful in data collection
because we want. Yes, yes, yes, this is a very smart question and comment. This is more like a call, you know, like you know. Yeah, this is a very smart question and smart questions. They they stand on themselves. Yes, you know, of course. Yeah, very good observation. I don't even call that a question.
Yeah, I in in Selena think about that. Because I mean, yeah, there is something here. What she says is it's very, very, you know we need, and that's why those apps are also very appealing to us, because it classifies us. It gives us a sense of identity, or I am slam. I'm, not slam. I am I am, you know I I you know I I I did that little. How many steps that make that makes me fit. I mean, you know, like it gives an identity.
you know. So look people
here. Second, I do you
Not all identities change? Look, I just told you guys.
that identity change over time, and I'm going to contradict myself. I'm going to make it more nuanced. Not all identities change. Okay, or or let's make it even more, and once some identities are really hard to change, I'll give you my example. I am Brazilian, and I have an accent.
It's really hard to change the accent I could imitate. I could imitate like more kind of America, you know, like, but I don't, but it's hard. It would be hard
and in, and and and my nationality I'm Brazilian I mean, nothing is gonna you raise that. I was born that country i've been. I'm 42, and I've been away for about 22 years.
so I've lived in
like 6 countries so far, but I am Brazilian.
I mean I can hide.
I can try, even like, you know. I eventually i'm gonna get a a a a passport to I'll keep my presumed, cause I can have dual, but like, you know, but I mean. I could even, like, you know, get some some passport for a country that I could drop to my national, my my citizenship, my Brazilian and censorship, but
but but it's really pretty them, but hard to be raised that, you know.
So we have primary and secondary identities, primary identities. They are harder to change age.
Yeah, age is biological, but it's it's social, too. Koreans in Korea, for example, they count, if you know, if I am actually I was born in 1,980, so that makes me 42. But if I was Korea and then you asked me, how old are you? I'm gonna say 43, because that year that I was my mom's won. That counts
for Korean people. So you you see what it means. It's social. True, it's not just biological, I mean. So age is really hard to change. You can lie about it, I mean, you know you can dye your hair? You can. Do you know, you can look like plastic surgery, but to me
it's something hard to kind of, you know. There's some point you can't really, you know, hide, or you know you, it gives out nationality, ethnicity scheme, caller, I mean. I know some people they did change, or they had some sort of illness that change their caller, you know, like like Michael Jackson, for example. But I mean
but it's very pretty them hard to to do that, you know. Even certain group membership is hard to change. Sex is something hard to change. Not easy people.
you know. If you want to have like sex as a reassigned assignment to surgery. I mean, you gotta see the psychologist. It's not easy even gender.
It's not an easy process. I mean, if you know anything about gender studies, or if you'll know anybody who, you know is a transgender person, I mean, it is got them hard process to go through it. It can be very painful a lot of suffering and a lot of bullying, you know, because of that I mean it's not easy.
right so so, and and also something that I probably I won't have time to cover the 3 points. But, like this other point here like that, your primary identity is like a age nationality ethnic, and can call, or, you know, certain group membership sex gender.
It's regulated by this by the state by this State bureaucracy. Like my family, I cannot erase
I come from whatever family I mean. I might not like my family; but if if I go and ask the judge to remove the name of my parents from my birth certificate. They're not going to do it, you know. If I ask, you know, you know, if I ask it to raise my nationality from my immigration documents in Canada. They're not going to do it. They're going to see. No, no, we need to know that you are proceeding like the government of Canada is not going to raise my nationality. Once I I become a a a seats, and in Canada. So you know what I mean. Like.
You know your sex, your caller, your sex, your sex, that you're born I mean your gender. Now it's easier to change in documents, but still it's not a very easy process. It's not just like you still have to go down there to forms, you know.
So your primary identity is there usually regulated by state power, and whenever you manage to change, I know times up to change your primary identity that there is a huge outcry, huge. Okay. So i'm going to stop here today. I will stay and read the chats.
I make a comment, but I like for those of you who need to go. I'll like to thank you very much.
We're gonna stop. I'm gonna send you the page that we're going to stop for this, but it's pretty much page 2. I think 2 0r 3. But i'm gonna send you the page that we're gonna stop for this, and he this is the cut off from the exam. Okay. So i'm going to stay here and and read the chat.
I'm gonna keep whatever I read on the record, I mean. So, you guys, you know, this is a nice comments that you have here. And but thank you very much, and I wish you guys a very nice day, and you're gonna come back here for next week, and we're gonna discuss the the third idea. That is really important. Okay.
So you guys goal and you have a good good Good day. Take care of yourself, and let me see what people wrote.
Oh, Selena has not another comment. I wonder if you know we could force an identity. It does. It does force an identity. So you have. Selena here is asking.
you know, if at some point like the surveillance, like the the profiles that are generated if they can force identity. Yeah, they can. And they often thus. And this is a problem. We're going to discuss that next class. I'm: going to even keep. We can actually keep those chats.
I'm: not gonna. I'm gonna keep what people said here. I'm gonna copy and base. I'm gonna keep it because I want to go back to this, you know, next class.
So people thank you so much.
You know. You guys take care of yourselves.
I'm just call him saving here this stuff, you know the comments.
So thank you very much. And you guys take care. Okay, If you get anything down to check.
Okay.

Feb 14

"Hey, folks! Hello, everybody, Welcome back. We don't have a lot of people
today, and I kind of know why I think everybody's kind of. Okay, I'm going to skip class. I'm: going to study.
Yes, Great. So I said that, you know. Yeah, I think you guys should be okay. Let me just say a few things about the exam. First thing is.
I am gonna be available on the zoom call like next
on on on Thursday.
But I I also will be available through email. So if you need me, you can come in the call or you can call. You can email me, you know you can see where you know if something happens right, like something extremely like drastic, like something big happens.
So you know where to find me, so there is no need to for account. Okay.
Oh, like. So that's the first thing. So i'm going to be available.
Yeah, so that's the thing. I mean, you. It will flag. So you you should come in here, Selena. Only if if let's suppose your Internet goes down, then you you know, or you just have your cell phone, Internet or if some something very huge happens, and then you you know where to find me, because I know that you know when whenever I because I've I've thought so many times. I know that whenever they quite often people do, they do have problems. I mean, quite especially like in large classes like this, right? So
so in case something major happens, I I mean, not con nude. Your house catches fire. I mean, not gonna do it. Okay or something, Major. I mean, you need to leave the exam site, or you know you are taking the exam at the library, and then the you know the alarm goes off, and then you have to evacuate
the building. I mean something, Major. Right? So and then you wanna get a hold of me. You can email me, or you can just come to the zoom, like to the zoom, to the meeting, to the classroom meeting
again. Your you will not be able to be here.
you know, in this virtual platform and taking the exam at the same time. Because again you're gonna be flagged. Okay. But i'm gonna be available to you in case something happens. That's what I want you to know.
Okay.
yes, she how I saw your email. I actually didn't have time to check. But I I will. I'll check right after class and get back to you. Okay, through email. So Don't worry about it. I'm gonna take care of you. Just I saw your email like like earlier today, but it it. It has been a busy day. So
but I i'll take care of you. Is that okay, people? So you are not gonna come and we're not gonna have class. Obviously, because we're gonna have the exam. So what you're gonna do is i'm gonna open the exam like 3 20.
Okay? So i'm gonna open the exam. 3 20.
So that means that you know you can kind of get starting and and and i'm gonna close the exam as soon as class classes over. So you should submit. You know i'm gonna time the exam. So if you don't submit, it's gonna it's gonna finish, anyway. So be mindful of of the time. So the exams gonna take the Normal class time. So we go from from 3 30 0r I'm gonna open it at at 3 20,
and we go all the way to
for 50.
Okay, so is that a. Is that okay? It's the normal class time. So be mindful. But put some sort of watch in front of you alarm clock or something, so you can just know when to submit.
Okay, you know that because if you don't submit the system, we'll submit and then let's suppose you have 2 questions to answer. You're going to miss those 2 questions. Is that okay? People?
Is it clear?
Yep. Okay.
Okay, Great. So again, if if something super huge happens, i'm gonna be available on the email. I'm gonna be just watching my email. And i'm gonna be als0 0n this call. So you can always come to the call if something major happens. But again, you should not be in the call and taking the exam at the same time, because.
you know.
Okay, let's suppose that you need to go to the washroom. There's something I mean, you know. You wait something. You're feeling like. You really need to go to the washroom. Obviously you go to the washroom, and then you, you tell me, Marcella, you know that flag.
I I had to go to the washroom, and then I will check your I mean I have access to all the recordings. This is like a hyper surveillance, so I can go and double, check and and and see, you know your moves and everything. So everything's tracked in the system, so I can always go and check. So so again it it's not like. Let's suppose you wanna have. You know you really need to go, you know, P. I mean if you if you don't, I mean no, I mean, please go
be very fast, because I mean this is exam right like it's eating up your time. But and let's suppose that something very serious happened that I mean, you know, you got really sick, and then you're gonna have to come and see me as soon as possible or email me or and then we're gonna have to sort that out
so. But the point is, I don't want you guys to be like freaking out to the point that you really you're sick. You need to use the toilet, but it just don't go it because you are afraid, I mean I mean come on you your well, I mean, I expect some honesty, integrity, and and like, you know, and I, I have ways to check
your honesty and your integrity. But you know. But again, I don't want anybody, you know, like
like you know, fantastic or or you know I don't need I don't I don't like we don't want to have you know the ambulance involved. Because you guys were like, you know, super sick and is a clear people mean just like, Be reasonable, okay.
And if you leave your chair. It will flag, but it's fine. I can always, you know. I can always go in there and check, you know. I'm not gonna g0 0, you know your exam has been flagged. Therefore you're getting a 0. No, that's not how it works.
Is that okay.
Yes or no? Okay. people. Another thing that I want to say to you the the questions they are fairly easy. I mean I
I was like very mindful that I I mean again. I want you guys to do well on this exam, because that takes the pressure away from everything else, because I mean at least you okay did. Well, so most of my questions as you saw in the Study guide. They go for the easier easier Orange calls. You know
all my questions, all of them. They overlap, I mean every single thing that i'm asking on the exam I covered in class. So there's nothing kind of a hidden in the article. There is like literally no information doesn't mean that you don't have to read. No, it means, I mean, if you read, you feel more.
I mean that you absorb better, right like it's more inside of you. But worst case scenario, let's suppose you show up in here. We thought reading nothing. I mean, if you came to class, and if you took notes, and if your mind was in class, I mean you should, you should be able to do well. I mean.
you know more than 60 for sure. But if you really kind of got engaged with the course, and you did some reading, you should expect I I am expecting something around 80 and 90 0r even above. Okay. So so please don't like Don't. Be nervous. I mean, there's no need for that. There's no
there's no trickery. There's no like pitfalls. There's no it's a very straightforward exam.
I just need you to read carefully the outline. Make sure that you're getting what is correct for correct what is not correct for for not correct, you know, like just be careful, Read, you know don't go like crazy trying to cover. Everything goes slowly but steady, and read everything, and and make sure. And again.
the exam has no traps, meaning that I mean. you know it's
don't don't try to.
because usually my students they go, Marcel out. This. This is too easy. It cannot be that easy it can't be. I mean, i'm sure that there is something hidden in this question. And then that's when people start t0 0verthink, and there and then they just because they are s0 0bsessed about being tricked
that they actually they trick themselves. They go, they know the answer, but they go into something that they believe it's not quite there, but they say that it can't be that easy. So it is easy. Trust me, it is easy. So trust yourself when you come up with an answer. Just trust yourself.
So. Number One read the outline. Don't go with too much excited. Try to kind of count. Pace yourself. you know.
before the exam, if possible, go for a walk. Come back, face yourself really carefully, you know you don't need to do each question many times. You just do each question once, although the exam will allow you to go back and forth.
You know you. You can go back and forth. How many times you want. But I mean there is no need for that. I mean, just go steady, you know. Same pace. And you should. You should be good, you should be, you know, and trust yourself. Okay?
Questions. I can't give much more than that, because I'm going to start to give the questions here. But I mean any concern, anything that you want to talk about before we start, and today's class
we will not be on the exam, and even like for the reading that I gave you last class is going to be just like a 2 page 2 first paragraph, so that you know it's like so pretty much the cut off was less class. You know today everything that we study here is going to be, for you know it's going to be for later for the final exam.
Okay, you don't have any questions, any comments any concerns, we can go ahead right again. You don't come to class. I just i'm just saying that because in the last 24 h I got like
I don't know 20 emails of people saying Marcella, should they come to class next? How how it's gonna be? No, the way it's gonna be. Is, it's class time. You g0 0n on. I'm gonna send an email, but it's class time. You just go in there and you take the exam. Okay.
let me just say, Here.
hold on, there's just some people sending stuff here for me. This not just read it. I can answer a fault identifying the person.
Okay. So I just j like more enough. What kind of let's suppose that you guys have.
I'm gonna give you some examples here. I'm speaking back to a comment that I just received that it's it's a direct. It's not on the chat. So let's suppose that you have that you know you are like me, and you have 2 screens. I have 2 screens here in my office. So in my setup
it's okay. I mean, I I know that you're gonna be like. Oh, you're gonna be kind of, you know, moving and like looking at other things. And i'm gonna be able to see your you on on camera. So it's okay, because you know what it was supposed to do when you log in is like you show you give me a tour a 360 tour of your setup.
and then I know. Okay, there is another screen there, you know I can. You know I can. I can, I can tell. I mean, you know, and also the the system here, the complex Sam and the technology that it's it's built in a way that really tracks you so I can even track what kind of device you have, so I I can. I can see what you have, you know, like, so it's hyper surveillance. So
so you don't have to worry about that. Okay, You have 2 screens in case you have a dog in case you you you want to have your dog, and you're like close to you or your cat, you know, or you. You know you have something that I mean
just to kind of make you feel comfortable. It's fine. Okay, Just so, you guys know.
But of course, if you do have quite specific questions, you can stay and we can talk. Okay, later. I mean.
yeah, the content. Yeah, today's content, Jenna. It's gonna be after that page 2. So it's gonna be covering all the rest. Okay, but that the whatever is after that that page 2 paragraph one, it's not gonna be on the exam. So the cut off was last week.
We like a shint. I was asking me if if that you guys should be more attention to study guide, I mean, I gave the study guide just telling you Where?
Where? Wh? What is telling you that study guys that look like. For example, the first article, which is an introduction to a book
he has like 10 questions.
and that is a very easy article. So if i'm going to let's suppose you are in a hurry, and you don't have much time to study. Where would you study? I I would study where there are more questions right? Because then your your chances to get.
you know I mean, if like. Let's let's suppose hypothet hypotheses like a situation. You didn't have time to study, and then now you want to study. I mean last minute. I mean, that's not ideal, but anyways okay, which what? I'm going to read. If I have to pick and choose you're going to pick and choose whatever where you see more questions. Right? So, and I purposely put more questions on this easy stuff.
So so that's what that's where and again how to study, how to study. So you know that you know that first article has done questions. I mean. I would.
So I hope that helps you kind of especially people who are, you know. Yeah.
and in some stuff is kind of like harder. I recall we have one article talking about the Paul like the policy, the governance of of of privacy. I'm gonna have questions about that article, but i'm gonna have questions like, you know, from specific pages.
You know that I gave you in this study guide, and whatever I'm gonna ask, I actually discussed in class as well.
So if you read, you will know if you paid attention to your class. You should not. You know you get what I'm saying when I say overlap, I mean it is there. It is also in the class, you know. So
So anyways, I look for what I hope you guys are gonna do Well, and I look forward to seeing your marks, and i'm not gonna release the marks immediately. I am gonna release. Probably like it's gonna take me a for a few days.
So because I usually have, like, you know, I have like students who, you know something always happens right, because this is a too big of a class. So sometimes something always happens. So if in case I need to, you know, withhold the exam.
So i'm gonna wait for you know, Once you everything is okay, everybody put the exam. Everything is fine that I released the marks, but it should take like you should take from a few days to a week. No more than that. Okay, then you get your mark back
What else?
I think that's it concerns questions again. No, yes.
hey, people, i'm going to share my screen, and we're going to get. We're going to pick it up from where we left.
If you have any questions, just interrupt me, please.
I really want you guys to feel confident, and I know that now I mean a lot of you. You are taking like 5 courses, and it's just too much stuff. and I know that, even though I think I mean my opinions at this course is easy. I don't know. If you agree with me, and just see the chat here.
it will, it will. Actually.
I have. I have. Yeah. So you will be there. I'm. Just go see this study guide. Hold on a second.
and we because I I do have questions in there that should say you should say something in a study guide. I actually have questions about the interview, you know.
Hold on a second people. I'm just going there again to study guide. So I can
I. I have this study guide in front of me here.
Yeah, look I I can't remember who asked that question. Let's share this very quick, you know.
Share screen here.
Look. it is right in here. Can you see?
And look? I have 9 questions.
That is another, you know, kind of easy hanging fruit, you know. So like the interview itself. I have questions from the interview, and I do have questions from the excerpts. Okay, that we discussed in class. So I have that, you know. So
so, anyway, so like that's another one easy hanging fruit here, you know, 9 t0 10.
Yeah.
This one, too. I have quite a few, because this is a very important piece, that this is a very important article. The new one who took surveillance. They must know that article well, and also this one here by Deluse, is also very famous. So that's why I have so many questions, so
what I try to do is like. I try to kind of see what is easy, what might not be super easy, but I I know that I covered well in class, and that's where it but it's important. So that's where the questions are going. Okay.
let's just see here.
No no worries. People. Don't worry.
Yeah, No worry you. You got it, I mean, anyways, I mean it's it's better. It's. You know it's better how you guys saying in English, it's better something than sorry, right like I, I I say, but it's, you know. You ask.
You know you had always asked community. There is no no problem. Okay. So now back to the to class.
Hope you guys see some. It's better something than sorry it's better. I forgot not how to say that. But anyways.
okay. So we were here just very, very quickly recap. So we are discussing this article. It's called Serve identity surveillance and all their energy sorting out Who's wh0 0kay, this is in a book.
It's in a book that I was actually added by Kevin Hagerty, the author it's called Richard Jenkins, and he is in the Uk.
It does university up there where you see this slide. And then we talked a little bit about identity, and how we develop our identity. I would have a question. I would actually have a question about that. You know the question. I I I told you that there is this concept.
Hello, people! There is this concept called Looking Glass Self, that it is really important because it speaks how it it speaks to how we build our identity. Okay. So this idea that the way that my identity as Marcella
this is, but on on what I think that you guys think of me right? So there's a name for this movement, I think what you think of me. It's called looking less self. Remember this for the exam, because there will be a question in there asking that, you know. So here we just. We just got one question from the exam.
and and then I I told you that it. Our identity is not something simple, that we have many identities. We play many roles in each of the roles that we play in society like as a mother, as a student, as a sister, as a niece as our ground
Grim, a granddaughter, grand son grant someone I mean. You know You always have roles, as in at the workplace, as a a professional, you know. And then I told you that we humans we are constantly keeping. We keep kind of like looking for queues and similarities across people in in between people and in people, so we can classify them. And I know that so far, probably, to today on to today. You thought that classification was
something terrible, and I am trying to say, look not quite. I mean, actually, we classify the world. We classify everything. We classify the order, you know. So if someone sits close to me and look at this person, they go like, okay, who's this person, and then my brain immediately tries to classify the person so to classify is just the way that we produce knowledge. However, I told you that what the the whole problem here is that i'll quite, quite often our classification, the way that we classify people birds.
it's, you know, chairs, computers. It has to do with preconceived knowledge. Knowledge it has to do with like generalizations. He has to do with like thinking poorly of people so like, you know, we tend to kind of classify in a ways that quite often we carry
into that classification system, like norms that are sometimes embedded in races with sexes in discrimination, and even in ignorance, right? Sometimes we don't know which is classified right. So
So I told you that this is part of the human brain, and that's why I have this big picture here, so you never forget that to classify is I mean it. It's kind of what makes us human. It's. There will be like you, I there's a question also in the exam that I ask you. You know i'm kind of being more broader about this class today's class, and not today, but this the
because I'm. I'm. I'm recapping last class, right? So like I have questions about what is what is true or what is correct, based on the lecture. One of the ideas that is correct is that you know the ability to classify is human. Okay, that we organize knowledge. We produce knowledge through classification. So this is going to be there. Is this: is this true? Yeah, this is true, right? So that one is true. So
and I also told you that you know the purpose of classification is produce knowledge and and also stability, like we kind of. We can predict if I know that you know this. Those animals in there are our lions, and I know that lions they like to eat like beef.
and they know that you know that lions we associate me with beef.
I'm going to run, or i'm gonna do something. I'm not going to be exposed to alliance. So it's like it's so. That knowledge, that classification, you know. I classify those animals as very dangerous. Therefore I, you know, when I see them I can predict my behavior, and I can predict data behavior. So I know you know that i'm gonna climb some tree. I'm gonna stay in there forever. And and also it's it has to be for our safety. So I covered all of that
last class. We talked about this idea Number one in the article that has to do with like the classification with the identity being, it's a process it keeps changing. And that's why a lot of people, for example, after let's say.
actually, I know quite a few people wh0 0n their like late forties, they just came. Okay, They came out, or they they say, oh, you know, they realize that they they that up to that that part in your life they were have sexual. And then, all of a sudden, you say, oh, you know, actually I just realized that I could, you know, starting today, or that these days I just like the same sex. And then, you know. So this is quite common, You know we've seen every year in social media we see like famous figures. Say, oh, coming out as gay
and just to give you an example, so is it like, you know? Maybe they didn't know that they were. Maybe they just became then. Maybe they just acted on something that was there. We don't know exactly. You know that's the topic for another class for gender studies. But the point is, the identity is changing
right? So so that's why I have this bearers I have. This leaves so like, you know, it's just changing identity. So keep this in mind also. I will have a question about that on the exam because this was covered last class I'm. Just recapping here.
And also this is also it's gonna be a topic in this. This is gonna show up in the exam that the article, Richard, he says, look ideally, we should use the word identification instead of identity.
Why? Because identification is a mound just like identity is a noun, but it gives out that that idea that things change over time. It's a process right. It's not something that's given. No, it's a process that you you are always building that process right? So your version of today, your yourself today is not the same self as in high school, and your high school self is not the same self as in middle school, and and probably your yourself tomorrow.
you know, in the job. Mark it's not going to be the same
like kind of identity that you have today, you know, when you are, you know, going through university. So, anyway, so keep this in mind. This is a very important idea that we it's gonna appear in the exam. How i'm gonna ask it's gonna be that. You know what is true
about. I did your what is correct, based on class discussions in the article, and one of the things is that you know that we should use the the word identification instead of identity. So it's. It's fairly easy. You know the exam.
So this is that's where we stopped.
We are having a conversation here. This is another, you know idea, and and themes and arguments from the article regarding identity is that not every identity change? This is actually basic sociology. So it's all t0 101.
So people who took sociology 100, they should know this, I mean so identity, I mean, we have primary identity, and we have secondary and primary identity. They are harder to change, and they are usually regulated by the government.
And this will be als0 0n the exam like that, you know. Is it true? Yeah, it's true, you know. Primary identity is regulated by the government.
Come on, think about when you're born. You know you have a birth certificate. That's not tell what time you were born. Who are your parents? What nationality you are! You know it's not. Tell everything about you right so. And then you know it's going to regulate your age, right? Your age is gonna go back to that document. That's it's your birth certificate.
and in some countries not in Canada, but in some countries they they record ethnicity in the birth certificate, you know. So in China, for example, they do that, you know. So
and then, like your scheme, call, or is also primary identity. Again Michael Jackson changed his, but it's for work. Probably some people say that he had. What is the name Vitilig0 0r Vitamin Vitlago? I think, in English.
He had this like illness, that you know that pigmentation of your scheme changes. So we don't like to what extent was just a disease or was just him. Okay, since I have this this disease, any any way, i'm gonna just like do some something to make it all uniform. My my skin caller right? So
so. But it's hard. I mean it's not easy, and even like sex and gender. It's really hard to change, I mean, you know. And and you know, I mean, there's a lot of stigma, a lot of suffering that goes with like, you know. And that's why we have the Lgbtq 2 plus movement, you know.
Well, no. We have a Lgbtq 2 yeah. 2 plus movement. The I believe there's more letters in there, but varies up into the language. But, like you know, the the we have, the movement tries to come on. You know we need to respect. We need to be. This is not easy, so there's a lot going on right so. But still, you know, whenever we change our
primary identity.
It it usually there is a huge huge outcry right like oh, you know it's a big deal, because again, it's primary identity. A lot of social norms are built around that doesn't mean that we cannot change. No, I I think people should be free and do whatever you want.
but it's just harder. That's that's the part here, right like, and and and also it's
but it's also interesting. If I can take a second here, let me just see the chat of it. Legal. Yeah, okay.
yeah, Exactly. Yeah, exactly. You can treat that. And also.
and not only that tool and not, but also you can use stuff that makes you know the pick, the the the the pigmentation of your I think you can, I? Well, I've seen a documentary about Jackson that says that I mean that I mean it costs a lot of money like this. This is where they reach.
but they can use creams that they make your skin. They kind of adjust the tone so because it legal makes it white, right like very, very white. Actually like white, that it's kind of paper, white.
And and then, you know, people use the people who have lots of money to do that kind of a care. I mean they they buy stuff that, or they get the you know they purchase.
they get stuff manipulated for them. That is, actually that helps with the to make it more uniform.
Yeah, that's what people tell me that it's extremely extremely hard to treat it. I mean that that eventually that you know there's not people just to get whatever, you know, because it's so hard to treat, and expensive. That's what I hear. But I don't know much about it.
but I appreciate your comments here so so you can. So you can tell. Probably, Larry said, that I mean, you know I mean well. It depends to you what extension and how severe is if it's illegal. But that's something that really changed, and people see right like calls people Attention! People watch this, you know there's something here right when you are, you know, anyways, like I'm getting from the again from the documentary from Michael Jackson that I mean
people would like in the beginning people like what? What's going on here right like it. It can be a subject of stigma. It can be right so and so that's well. I personally think that's really important to talk and share. And then I I thank you, Larry, for sharing, because I mean again, the best way always is just like
I mean
it's right, but it's it's just talk about things and and and make people understand things, and that always is the best best way to fight to fight stigma, to fight in tolerance, to fight. Discrimination is actually, in my opinion, is to, you know, expose things and and and talk about it.
Another thing, but I I wanna make a comment here. It's so funny. I mean this I mean, even though I just told you. Look, this is not for the exam. This is just like I want you to think about this
my primary identity, I mean.
you know, like when I in Brazil, like you guys, know that I I come from Brazil in Brazil. I am white, right like that's how the Brazil in Brazil society. I am classified as white. So therefore my identity has to do with like white, like, you know, being white and and
like, you know, like experience, things that white people experience being that usually it's better. It's more privilege in Brazil so. And but here in Canada, when I first came to Canada, I was completely like.
0 0bli oblivious to how Canada works like that, was it many years ago, and it was funny because I I very quickly I realized in Canada that people would not treat me as white, you know, meaning that I mean, I I start to kind of experience
the discrimination and some sort of prejudice and and kind of you know, looks weird. Looks that I was like this Something weird going on in here, like you know, the way that i'm being treated.
and I was like this is interesting.
and and then it like eventually, my Canadian friends. Marcel, you're not white for us. You're kind of brown, you know. You were a kind of like light brown. But you're not white. Definitely so. So it's funny because of what i'm sharing this with you, because I mean, I was classified like for years as white. And then, all of a sudden, I was that classification flipped.
and in my country, you know, I had all those privileges of being white, and or or you know, or I did not have to go through the ordeal that black folks have to go through in Brazil.
and and all of a sudden in Canada. I start to kind of get the looks that I saw black folks in Brazil getting, you know, so th it's very interesting, you know I mean again my identity, and now and now my my personal identity. How I see myself change it after so many years in Canada.
you know, and be being confined as brown. That changes me. you know, and it changed for good, actually, because I well, I have always been. I have always been like
filing racism and discrimination in Brazil and elsewhere. but a kind of an activist when it comes to that.
But after I became even more, you know, kind of I was like by picking even more sensitive and aware of of You know, of discrimination, skiing any kind of scheme, or in ethnic kind of discrimination. It's interesting that kind of you know, experiencing 2 worlds. You know
it. It kind of it was interesting, you know. I mean not easy, but that she. And now I see. How do you see yourself
now? I see myself as
it's kind of brownish, you know, and and it's funny, because in the United States. I I often go to the United States, and there they also don't don't see me as as white. They They also don't see me. They don't see me as brown. There they see me as a Latin0 0r Latina, or lectures on X. That's the new name. Let me, Max.
or let's next. I mean, you know, and but it's funny because I don't identify as Latina, not in, and I am Latina. I'm from Brazil, but like in in the United States. Latina means to be Hispanic.
and and i'm not Hispanic, because I don't speak Spanish, I mean, I do speak Spanish, but
I don't speak Spanish like. Originally it's not my mother language. My mother language is Portuguese, so i'm not hispanic. I am loose of phone. Looser phone is the name for people who speak Portuguese, so it's like, Say, but it might. So you see. So now I have another layer like Which is it to be Latina to the Max Hispanic, but I don't feel hispanic. I don't really like right now I do. But I I well, not not very much. But I don't really like natural in toadas, you know, like the Spanish food, and i'm not really into it.
But again, but in in in the United States, every time that i'm there, people say, oh, you know, let's go for Hispanic because you might love it. I was like, and then I go like, yeah. Well, I don't really love it. But we can lose Spanish, you know, or or Hispanic food, or Mexican food, so you know. So that's I mean, Anyways, I'm sharing this with you, because
my purpose here is to kind of make you think
about those identities and how you are classified, and how you you are classified, how that impacts you
right so, and that goes back t0 0ne comment that I had here last class that I really enjoyed. It was a question slash, comment. I can't I have? I took a note of that, but I can't remember who was it? And I don't want to put my slide down to see it.
But someone in class. Last time we met they they told me, Marcella, so like those profiles that we have on social media that they're They are the result of surveillance. Those profiles they really change us.
And I love that comment. I I think this is a very smart comment, and deserves writing, you know. I mean whoever said that, or all of us, we we should think about it, and even write about it because yes, indeed, I mean the profiles they really get to us.
So again, people do surveillance. They produce profiles. They put this which are based on classifications. That's why we're talking about classifications. And then you know that really gets to us just like I'm sharing with you here, you know. I'm called now hispanic. But I don't feel hispanic, and I don't feel like Tina, because Latina is the Spanish usually like the expanded Mexicans and not Mexicans. So it's just like, you know.
Anyways, I mean, do you guys get what i'm getting where I'm going with this thing like it doesn't make sense to you or no.
or I am kind of
what are you talking about.
I just see if someone can tell me here. Yeah, you can. You understand? Make sense? Okay, it's reasonable, right? Like what i'm trying to say here.
extremely complex, you know, and really you know how people classify. They really change you. Another example. I have a Canadian, but just my I have. I want to share those with you guys. I don't know if I I don't think I shared yet. I have a very good friend here in Canada.
She's from Ontario, and she's in Ottawa right now. She She lives in in Ottawa, and she is Canadian. She was born and raised in Canada. Her father. I don't know if I told you guys about this friend. Her father is from Shri Lanka
as brown as he gets her mom's from is from like
Ireland.
Okay.
Her skin color is like on the it's she's kind of brown like she's browner than the darker than me, you know. Screen skin color wise, and you guys have no idea how much like the kinds of stuff that she here. So she keeps. She tell me about like being a kid.
and like, you know, like obviously, that that she was she. She can't remember that story was her mom who told her so. Her mom would go around, you know, like in the like in the neighborhood, with her kind of nose for the stroller, and people would say, oh.
you have a daughter now, what a nice schedule! You know one of my scholars. She has like people, make comments, and then they would go like
Oh, I didn't know that you guys adopted
like so people would assume, and would immediately classify her as in the adoptee and like. But she is not adopted, I mean she's. She's the the daughter of a mixed marriage. And so she grew up listening to people classifying her, as
you know, as a person was adopted, and and and also getting all sorts of abuse because her her parents they live now like. Later on they made money, and they were in a rich neighborhood in Toronto, and that neighborhood was very much white. So
so the neighborhood did not welcome the fact that they had a a kid that was Brown, actually 3 kids who were brown.
and and there are stores of like her mom watching her in soccer practice, you know, in that neighborhood. And then, like you know, someone who I think I told you guys, this people you tell me because I mean, you know I'm getting older, and i'm starting to repeat my stories, and I teach too much, so I just can't remember what I said and what I didn't say exactly in each class.
But anyways, although i'm just teaching this class now. But anyway, so like this, Mother said to this
other Irish woman, My friends mom, oh, you know I can't believe you know like. Now this this neighborhood is full of immigrants, the immigrants. They're coming here. Now, look at those kids, you know. There's like, Can you see that that, kid? You know that that girl over there like how brown she is. And
the woman was actually talking to the mother of the brown kid.
You guys get it. How bad it got like so pretty much like her entire life was this. And then later she tried to study immigration. So she's an expert in immigration in Canada. Actually, this friend of mine, and she works, for she worked for
Ircc, which is the immigration department in Canada.
and and she actually she. She stayed in there for 5 0r 6 years, and now she has her own business. She doesn't work for them anymore, she resigned. Look, who resigns from a very well paid, well, paying government job. Nobody but she did, you know, and and now she has for business. But like one of the reasons why
she resigned that she hates the immigration policies in Canada, I mean, and she doesn't believe that that you know. I mean after working for the Department of Immigration, she doesn't believe that things can change and get better. So she left.
Another reason is that she got so much races in there. So she tells me that every single day for about 6 years when she was getting the elevator sugar up. You auto in the building like
we're talking about like
highly educated government employees. People would ask her so nice caller you have just did. You just come from Mexico? Shows like, No, I. This is my caller. My father is Sherlunk, and my mother is Irish. I was born in Canada, you know. There's no tan. There's no nothing. It's just me. And then oh.
your Brazilian! They would. They would mistake her, for it. She was like, No, i'm kinda so every single day she had to address like it's almost like her caller was a problem, you know, like every single day. So eventually she quit. Let me see what people tell you here. That happened to my mom, too.
Her dad's from India, and her mom is from. And you see same story. My mom was born and raised in Alberta. Yeah.
yeah, that's it. So that that's exactly the same story, I mean, you know.
but people imagine I mean, imagine, like, Thank you for sharing this. Is it, Macy? I think it's Macy right like let me see from let me know if i'm
because I want you to think about like this thing about being classified something
imagine I mean, if you were classified Jewish in in Second World War you could end up that killed, brutally assassinated by by the Government
if you were classified, Beth, By the way, we had 6 million Jewish people being brutally assassinated. Also Catholic people also were assassinated in the war, and also anyone who would at that time be called homosexual, which is like
that that's the only terminology at the time, right? So so imagine I mean, you get that label, and then look there's more. Once you get the label, pull on you through surveillance.
Once that label gets sticks on you, you know, like you, it's almost like that. There is this thing that there is an expectation that you're gonna have to act according to the label.
you know. And then, if you don't act according to the label, whatever label you are given.
I mean that becomes another problem.
and it becomes a problem on the individual level and becomes a problem with societal problem as well. Because your role you are in the wrong. It's almost like you are doing something wrong, and you are breaking some sort of norm. Right? So
so anyways people remember I already covered this third idea when I gave you kind of identity one on one. But that's an idea that you know that they did. The the offer builds up. I. We always keep in mind that identity. It's much, much, much bigger than just I me.
You know it's about us.
Our identity has to do with how people see us, and that's why I brought you this concept, which is not even in the article. This is not in the article I brought this from my sociology 101 class. So just to understand what we, you know how we build that identity. But later this we appear to be this understanding here, not the not the concept, not the label of the concept, but the understanding. It's going to show up
in this third idea that is right in the beginning of it there, right? So so you know. So it's really important. It's always relational
and identity. It happens through in direction. You guys are too young to remember. But, like there was a very famous movie like in the nineties that this guy was, you know, he somehow he ended up on an island alone.
and he, he, I, if you guys, remember the name of the movie you put on the chat. But this guy I I forgot the name of the movie. I forgot the name of the actor, which is a famous, very famous one, but anyways like he ended up in an island, and then he had this ball
that he painted some face, and he said that the ball became a person for him, and he would interact with the both the ball and that became like I I even think, got on Oscar or something. I mean that movie. It it touch it. People's heart because it talked about identity at the like. That was the whole thing about I mean, because I mean, we need people.
and if we don't have people, it's almost like we disappear, as you know, as a as a person, you know. So we are social beings, right? S0 0, yeah, that's exactly that you guys got it. I mean, that's exactly what i'm talking about. Okay. So look now, surveillance. So we talked a lot about identity.
And and again.
this is why we're talking about identity, because it's identity, has with classification, how we are classified, how we classify orders, how we classify ourselves, how how other people classify us, and surveillance produces classification. All that data that we collect.
either us or Google or Facebook, or whoever the data that is collected
it, it's it's for to good profiles like what Hegery called. By the way, this is going to be an exam what hegery called
data doubles, which profiles right, so like. So like you know we we create profiles. We cost you 5 people. We classify things. So you know, if you are browsing, you want to buy a run up. You want to go shopping for a home for a house. You want to buy a house, and then you are browsing a lot of Google like, you know, searching houses in that meeting all of a sudden you're going to be, you know. You're going to start to receive.
you know, advertisement about how you Why? Because Google classified you as someone who is a potential house owner or a house buyer, or someone wants to buy house or sell house. So it's like. So you get classified right, and that that changes the kinds of advertisements that you're getting, and even like how you think about yourself. And all of a sudden you become very aware that you are actually. You know that we get when we talk about something, and we see that something back
in our feed. One of the things like, okay, people are listening to us. That's the first thing that comes t0 0ur mind. The second thing is.
you start to think about who you are, right. So it's that that process that you are reflecting on your identity. Okay.
So here it's just an important part. I mean, of the of the whole article that it talks about like classifying a person categorizing a person or a group. You know it. It's it's a very important part of the process of identification.
So that's what surveillance does, right? So so I I put this in here because this is not going to be on this exam, but we'll show up in the next exam. You know the final one.
so let's see what else we have to cover, so look
so when you think about surveillance. You'd better think about social sorting. What is sorting, sorting. Is you trying t0 0rganize your wardrobe, you know, like your your bedroom, like you know, like it's when your parents they come and say, Look.
tide this up. This is very messy. So what you're trying to do. You're trying to sort all this is clean clothing. This is gonna go into basket. This is the All. This is clean. It goes back in your wardrobe. This is dirty, goes in the basket. This is my books. It goes into shell. So you're classifying that's what you're doing, and that's what surveillance does.
So surveillance people. It puts people in their place.
So surveillance looks at me and says, Marcella, here in Canada is brownish.
you know, so it puts it puts me in a place the place of someone with Brown, and therefore they expect me to act like Brown. But the problem is, what is that to act like Brown?
Who gets to say what Brownies forget to stay, what Brown act act like, or you know what kind of behavior Brown should have. This is absurd, right. He then he gets to this up so. But we do have expectations. So people, when they look at me, they expect that when they see me.
and when they look at me. And when I say, hi. people get okay. You know that's a corner. That's a You know that's an immigrant, that's you know, because they hear my, I mean. And then all sorts of expectation comes to mind right. 0 0kay, Marcel is an immigrant mar. Somebody is. And and just like these stores, and we were sharing me and Macy and me, I mean.
if you'll see a brown person like my friend, I mean, there is this expectation that you must be a foreigner.
and that's wrong. Right? I mean that's wrong. This country now by now is diverse enough. We have, like very like many generations of people here now that they did not come from. You know Ireland or England. No, they came, you know they. They. We also have people from you know parts of the world where you know people are not Caucasians, and that's it. But it doesn't
you know that's not in people's mind yet. Right? So there's always an expectation. So
if you tell people oh, I you know i'll I'll I'll be an example here since since we discussed that when when you tell some10, you know I have.
You know it might be wrong, you know. It might be it might. It might be that you are so so so so white
that you don't even you don't show right. People can tell, or it might be that you know you are that you were brown like me, but because the the illness is very advanced. So you know your whole call, or changed so you know people cannot tell, but you know, but we do have pre like preconceived notions, and that is the problem, because they are usually attached to values.
So but so remember surveillance boots, people in place, and that means expectation. So right down here, you know Bullet Point number one
that comes with expectations. And and here that's where it starts with suffering, you know, because that's where the stigma kicks in. That's where you know, like the discrimination kicks in, you know. Surveillance regulates or order
orders identification processes. So that's and that's the goes back to that very smart question comment that someone asked me, Marcella Profiles! Do they really interfere with Who you are? They do?
And that's why we have girls, Co. Meeting or dying from suicide, or taking their lives in everywhere in the world, because their vagina doesn't look like whatever vagina should look like, or or or or boys that are suffering, you know, because they are, you know, chest or or penis, or whatever that is doesn't look like according to the whatever expectation, whatever classification that they have been exposed.
Right. So So remember place regulation of identification processes.
and here
people that quite often people don't really know. You know they don't really know they were identified as a member of a specific group, because, you know, you think about.
Obviously, if you are, I mean, suffering some sort of discrimination, but because of your caller, or because of your accent, you will know. But but let's suppose that you know like. Let's think about. Let's think broader and more technical about surveillance.
When we think about cameras, we don't know how the cameras are classifying us. We don't know the cameras at the airport, how they are sorting us. We don't know what they're looking for. We we don't know what the algorithms you know inside of Google are looking for, because, as it is today, you know those algorithms, their secret, and and we don't have access to them. And that's exactly what the loss in Canada
and also in Europe. They're trying to change. They are making. They're trying. They're saying, Look, you're you're gonna make some search. Some some some search engine, your algorithm all the reason need to need to be accountable for it. It should be it should be.
The word is
jeez, what's the word that I use in the lecture. It needs to be audible. You need to go, you know, to be able to audit that you know it, to be able to see exactly how that algorithm works. And but as it is today, this is not happening yet. Okay, even in Europe, I mean.
they're more like Google and face Meta and Google and Amazon. They have to be more open about because they did legislation more advanced. But here in Canada we don't. We don't exactly what's going on right yet.
So and so, anyways. This is all too straight that we don't quite know how we are being classified, and that goes back to that article that I gave you guys about Google
Time tagging advertisement of anti abortion clinics to low income populations in the United States. You guys remember that I told you that? I said, Look.
you know Google is I gave. I shared with you like an article by the a newspaper, the Guardian, which is based actually in the Uk. But they were talking about America. So
again, what is the problem? The problem is like, they say, No, No, Google says we are not targeting low income.
Okay, but then show me the algorithm and they say, No, we cannot disclose that.
But what we know is that based on that arch cause that women, you know, a lot of black folks, black women in the United States, and who are also like when there is an overlap, you know, like they they're They're getting to the advertisement. So why the heck is going on right. So
another thing is that you gotta think about this thing here being sorted. Being classified has real consequences, real consequences in people's lives. And again, that goes back to the stores that we are sharing here in class, and I shared the other people shared. It has a real consequence. It doesn't have to be necessarily bad.
you know. It can be good. So, for example, let's suppose that you are diagnosed, which means classified right. You are classified
with some sort of label from the you know the manual of a Dsm. Which is the manual of of diagnosis and and Diseases. Right? So so let's suppose it like the psychological stuff like, let's suppose that you've classified with a G AD. Adhd.
Okay, on one side that that's not good right? Because oh, my gosh, this is like, okay. I have this on the flip side you do get. Let's suppose you do get, you know, accommodations, for example.
So that is good, right? So you know so. But the thing is that there is always consequences. They can be positive they can be negative. So we people who are interested in surveillance, we gotta think of the surveillance classifies. Okay, why are the consequences of that classification?
Is it good? Is it bad when when it's good? When is it bad? So we, you know, under which circumstances, what are the dynamics around good classifications? What are the dynamics around bad classifications? Sometimes things They can be both
right. They can be good at at the same time. So that's my invitation for you. So think about, You know always about the consequences of surveillance, the consequence of classification that comes together, which is the sorting part of surveillance. Right? So
i'm not so. Let's move, because I mean, this is what's just part one
of that article. as you can tell from here. Look part one. Now we're gonna do part 2 0kay. So let me just share with you. I are you guys.
Are you guys doing well in there.
People.
i'm sure just getting these slides here. Give me a second.
Okay, so let's go.
I don't know I I I told you that I I personally, I mean another personal note here.
I when I read this article that we're discussing
I got like, oh, my gosh! Surveillance is my thing, you know, because I I kind of I saw because I used to think of surveillance as just like technology, right like I didn't think about beyond the technology. And all of a sudden, when I saw this like oh, my gosh! There's so much going on in here. It it, you know
it. It's kind of mind blowing, I mean. And then that's when I decide. Okay, I'm gonna do my Phd: in surveillance studies. I'm going to specialize in surveillance. And i'm gonna, you know, do research on surveillance, right? So
So I don't know if you're gonna like this piece. But or if you liked what you read so far.
But
hey, someone just share this.
I can't.
Hey, folks, let's take part. 2. Now. Okay, part you. So
so it's the same. It's the same stuff. So I want to keep here. Look. Richard, the author. He conceptualizes surveillance for us. He defines surveillance. He offers a definition of surveillance in the article.
Okay, and he says, surveillance refers to processes in which special note is taken of certain human behaviors that g0 0ur goals well beyond it, though curiosity, curiosity.
Okay.
and he, this definition comes from Guy called David Lyon, David Lion. He is a very good friend of hegery, you know. I even I think that they even wrote together. If I remember that that surveillance assemblage
lion is his offer in that piece. Okay.
But look, i'd like you to take a moment. Read, I'll give you 10 s. Please read this definition
for yourself.
Now people think about the definition
that we discussed in the beginning of the course in that very article that are. We asked 10 questions about in the exam, the introduction to the book supervision.
and I told you that surveillance is monitoring. It is data collection for the purposes of governance. You do remember that. Do you guys remember that definition? That surveillance is monitoring
it's data collection for the for the purpose of governance, you remember? Yes or no. Let me let me know here in the chat.
Yes.
okay, that will be on the exam. People. I have a question asking.
You know, about the definition of surveillance.
Okay. So so remember, Marcella, what a surveillance! Again.
it's monitoring like it's like watching monitoring. You also can monitor with cameras. It's monitoring and and and also collecting data.
Why, what for governance? Okay.
so. And you can use. Remember that you can use low tech or high tech technology
in a in surveillance. You can monitor, and you can. They do data collection with your eyes and some piece of paper.
or you can put some. You can put in some, you know, some sort of camera equipped to effect fishing, the intelligence to do that for you, so it can go high, tech, low tech, but it's monitoring and data collection for the purpose of governance. What's the governance? Is it like country? No, it's like governing people's behavior.
Okay. So now that you remember that you have that fresh in your mind.
compare that definition here with this one. Which one do you like better this one or that other one. And the why, let's see if there is anybody who would like to share
folks.
Which definition do you do you like better as an academic, I mean, not like, you know, as an academic as a scholar, that you are.
Yeah, Joy says I. Think this one is a bit wide, I think so true.
There's, I think. Let me just see what Shannon. I think I like the first one better because it's concrete. Yes, people that that good definition is always a concrete definition like that actually allows you to think for like allows you to apply in a reality right? Like.
Yeah, exactly, Jenna, saying the same thing. And for me i'll share my personal thoughts here.
What I think about this definition here is that this is not very critical.
It's kind of almost like very descriptive and very kind of e if it makes it makes surveillance sound very, you know. Sent very, you know, you know, sent to me. This is like note
notes taking, you know, observations are taken, you know, from behavior. It's something that's beyond just being curious. It's something that you actually there's some sort of purpose. But again it's true to light to kind of, you know, to broad to you know, wide to exactly what you guys, and it's not very analytical. It's not very to the point, you know. So anyways, Why, i'm bringing that to you. Because
again, this is a 200 level class, right like in 200 level class.
There's just so much that you can do which is pretty much, or, you know, 100 200. What you do is you you with the students or the people taking the classes with like basic knowledge, so they can kind of okay, I I know. And you can now think about this topic. So
that's what 200 levels classes are very basic knowledge.
But I I would like you guys to think that I mean
whatever you read. you know not only my class, but in every class you have to be critical. All that you gotta keep, do I? Actually, I mean, of course, the the Professor might want me to know this. The Professor. My My test is in the exam. Fine. Okay, that's you know. That's the policy for the U. Of a whatever. But I would like you guys to take ownership of your education.
So, like, you know? Ask, do I actually agree with this? This is actually work. Is this actually good?
Is this actually applicable? So that's the thing that I would like you guys to do with the course right like in this course here, you know, like you to kind of interrogate surveillance right to think about surveillance all the time, and and also and again, you know this definition here, me as a scholar. I don't use it because I find it. It's too wide to broad, you know, but it is so. I like the article
they are to go inspired me to pursue surveillance studies, but that definition I just don't like it. But I I want to bring that to your attention, because I want you to think about what you're reading and what you're discussing, and not just like, Take it like as a robot. Okay, we don't need that. It's enough. We have enough of like robot
like, you know education. So
I I love your comment here. Shannon says, you know it does not address the why the purpose does not, and it it it not only does not, but it kind of you just hints kind of oh, you know something that's beyond curiosity, or or you know, like that's not enough.
Let's see what Jenna says. I kind of read like monitoring data collection for purpose.
regardless
because I I yeah. Oh, yeah, you're very right. Okay, very, very right. So I I mean, I agree with you so anyways. But look people
so keep in mind. I mean that there is, you know I want you to think about it. And but yet yet the article, Richard, the author of the Zar. Well, he says, well, look he, he doesn't really criticize lion.
but if you read that part, he has a little bit of a a little bit of saying, because you know, lions a very big name in the field. So people don't want to write and criticize him, but he goes like Look, there is more to it, right. So there is a purposes
purposes right so, and that's where you know that goes back t0 0ur that this whole conversation feeds back to that. You know the beginning of the course. So purpose of surveillance, based on Richard's article is management.
which is actually a for you. An idea, because, remember, full call is the guidance that in disciplinarian societies or disciplinary societies we manage life.
So it's not about killing people. It's about managing all aspects of life from birth to death. So this is a for you and kind of idea. So the purpose is management, and the purpose is protection.
Right? So in here I would like to take a moment and think a little bit about this, because
look purple of surveillance. I mean, management. Yeah, it is. Management like Google
collects date on us to manage what
us not really to manage the advertisement industry that is behind. You know, Google makes money with advertisements. That's how they make money. That's how they pay for the gmail that we get for free. That's how they you know we don't pay exactly to use Google.
It's kind of a free service, but it's not really free, because we are giving out our information to them. They process that information they classify as they produce profiles, and they sell that.
So advertisement to say, okay, you want to place an advertisement with me. What kind of people do want to sell to people in Alberta more specifically in Edmonton age 2025 people who have like wearing school. That will be you right, so like. So there, you know. So it's management management of what like money and industry of advertisement. That's one of that. That's what it is.
So you know it can be any kind of management, and here it depends. Usually there's profit involved. Usually money to be made right, so usually in most cases, but sometimes it's just like you know. You know the government of Canada. They like the the health care system they collect date on us
not so much to make money on us, but it's more like to keep us health to keep us healthy, right? So I mean so that's management management of life. So here, you see, like the application of that. So so we tend to think that there is some sort of evil
big, broader behind surveillance. Not necessarily. It's just managing right like. There is some sort of managerial thing going on for some sort of purpose that usually involves money, but not always not always right. Health care being, you know, an example
and protection. Look.
we usually say, Look, give up. Give me your data because we need to, you know. Give me your data because we need to protect you.
And this is unshan the idea of using surveillance for management. It's something that started in the eighteenth century, as
Michelle who call noted. He noted that right like okay, that that kind of you know, like that's the difference between the leper and the lap of the the the leper and the plague, right so like the he starts to think about like the the archives that he starts to that he's he that he did research on
about the plague. They all dated from the 19 from the eighteenth century. So that's when kind of we start to kind of approach, You know you surveillance for management, management of life and death.
Protection is is much, much, much older than management the purpose, protection. Look at this. Here we have the Great Wall of China. I'm sure you you are familiar with this picture.
and I here. I don't know if you guys can see here is like a. You know you walk, walk, walk, walk.
and then you get to this little houses, the towers, and then you walk, walk, walk, there is another tower, and then you walk, walk, walk. There is another tower. I don't know if you ever visit China, or I mean, but I I know I believe that you might know what i'm trying to say here. So
the whole purpose is as protection.
So those towers they are just like an opticans. They are like not not really like.
and it when the the the the wall, or the great wall, was built in China, it was like they start to build this wall like 300 years before Christ before Jesus Christ, you know. So it's like it's it's been like, you know, 2,000 plus years.
and this this building here has like so, and their concern was okay. We're going to build a little power in a way that
whoever is inside can see the outside. But the outside cannot see us here. They know that there is a wall. They know that there is a power, but they cannot really see the person, and also we can tell them. And China was at that time China was afraid of of invasions from Mongolia.
because at that time we had gain again. It's come, I think, in English. That's how we say Jane's skull or ging is like the Mongolian amper, and he was very powerful. He he concord all the way to Europe. So they were afraid of this guy here, and and you know, and they use the wall, you know.
you know, for for protection. And so you would be able to see someone coming from the North, meaning, you know, any any country in the North and invading China, and in, you know. But anyways I bought I brought this picture just surveillance. This is surveillance. This is low tech surveillance 2,000 years ago, you know.
It's too very powerful. And and so you remember protection. Okay.
Another idea from this article is that surveillance is one-sided. Oh, it's missing and D. Here.
you know it's missing and d
one-sided. So you just see one side we don't get to see. I mean, there's a camera that's Why, I put a camera in here. We're up an optical. You don't get to see what is inside right like, but they get to see you the same for the camera. You don't see the camera, and I don't know. If you guys remember
about 1010 15 years ago the cameras they were exactly like this one here
and some cameras they would move.
They were able to move. You know they you could guide. Okay, I want to see that side. You shift the camera.
the cameras. Now they're different. They They they look like a little
light.
is it, Bob? Bob? Boo? I don't know what to say that, Bob. I mean it's a little light fixture
that you don't really know where it's watching right like I don't know. If you guys noticed I mean probably don't remember, because you're too young. But the cameras. They used to be exactly like that, and they would go around now they are. They are like this. So you don't know we look at them, you know, if they're looking at you, or anyway, so they improve technology.
But the point I mean this is a point that is, it is made by Foucault. It is made in the an optic, and by Jeremy Benson. But this comes back. That that idea keeps coming back in surveillance studies right? So, and the the offer Here, Richard says.
surveillance is Ethel logical rather than ethnographic. What he means by that is.
ethology is the science that studies animal behavior like where humans they watch animals. We watch animals, animals that don't watch us back
so. And ethnography is a anthropology kind of strategy of data collection. Where you go, you go, and you do field work, and you meet people that's suppose you're going to study preceding the immigrants in Edmonton. You mean go with them. You watch them, and they watch you back, and you exchange with them is so. That is what ethnography is.
Surveillance is not about ethnography, surveillance, is itphology. I mean it's like just one person observing the order. So there is necessarily a hierarchy, because I watch, and you don't get to watch me
back. So there is a hierarchy of me over you, right? So
Oh, Tony, I'm gonna start the exam at 3 20 0kay. Just so, you know. Yeah.
Yeah, Matthew, when you're right about what you're saying. Nothing to hide. Yes, you're very right about it, you know again. So look, it's much bigger than just like oh, I have nothing to hide
people. It's about classification. Suppose sorry about your identity. It's about like creating profiles about you and telling you what you are and what you are not, and creating expectations for you to behave so.
It it's it's it's much bigger, you know, when people say oh, you know I I don't fear, because I have nothing to hide. I mean it's it. They're way off, way off, you know, a way off. So look, surveillance is in personal. Okay, very, very much in personal.
But that doesn't make sense. He does because it's not like you. Don't do surveillance on one people. One person you do surveillance on people.
and then you scan the environment, all the people. And then you look for someone who flags.
You don't. Go into each person.
think about me doing surveillance on the exam. I'm not going to be. I have like 200 people in this class. I'm not going to be doing. I don't have the I don't have the human capacity to watch.
You know 200 people.
So what I do is I make it in personal. There is an algorithm inside of Sam that's gonna tell me, Marcel, there is something suspicious going on in, You know, Student Id Number X. I will go check that person, but before you know it's it's in personal, and then it gets personal. But initially it's in personal
right. So
so you watch the population at large, and this is something that technology allowed for that. Because before technology, you you didn't have. I mean it's impossible. How do you control so many people, right? So
you know, digital technology made that easier made made surveillance much more in personal, and that goes back to the one that one, the example in that very first article that we read, which we will have 10 questions in the exam. You guys remember, like, go and read the one by example, like it is the author telling you? Look.
you know, like one that was a person, you know. She comes, you know she's black, and then she tries to get along. You know the the guy doesn't give her alone because she's an activist. She's black. No, No, no, and then, 10 years later her daughter comes and and she's black. Choose. She's an activist, but she gets the loan because surveillance looks at, you know, in a more impersonal, you know, so way. So you can protect from bias.
Right? So let me just see the chat.
Oh, Dony, I'll get back to you after class, because I just want to finish this idea here because I just have 3 min. Just hold on in there.
Yeah. Oh, I I still have a couple of slides. I won't be able to finish everything, but it's. Okay. Let's just d0 0ne more slide. So people stereotype surveillance again. It's about classification. So i'm telling you Look, it is impersonal.
So how does it happen, then? Classification. Right? Like classification, Stereotype
I Classification is a stereotype.
because I mean you don't again. Oh, I am brown, but i'm not quite brow. I don't feel as brown, but not became Brownie. It's more complex than that. But I mean but surveillance. What surveillance does is a pipe right? So it becomes a pipe.
So it classifies you. Transform you into type, which is essentially what Hegery said in the in the survey with assemblage, and you become a data double profile of type. Right so.
And you know. And then sometimes that profile has several classifications attached to it, sometimes just 1 2, I mean. It depends on how you set up your surveillance system. Right? So. And then people
the problem here. That's where i'm going to stop.
The problem is
like. How do you know if the person is actually
that classification that you assigned to her? How do you know how okay you? You call Marcella Brown? But how do you know, if she's actually brown?
That's the problem. Surveillance cannot really tell you. And that's where surveillance makes a lot of mistakes.
And I'm gonna stop here. Okay. The problem is how we interpret surveillance data. So you that suppose you are a security guard at the airport and the system flag, someone, the system says, Look here, we have a type. We have a profile. That is a risk profile.
How do you do as a guard? I mean, you have to actually talk to the person you have to, you know, interrogate the person.
and that's exactly what i'm gonna do in K Exam. All the system flag someone i'm not gonna go in there and say, 0 0, for you know, i'm gonna see what's going on. I'm gonna go watch the the tape, you know the footprint and see what's what's happening there.
You guys got what i'm saying, but we're gonna talk more about that next class. So look, I would like to thank you.
Tony. Please stay here so I can. I can talk. I can explain to you what's going on with the exam, and for those of you. Who are
we? We don't have any questions.
Feel free to go. I would like to thank you very much. Again. Don't, Freak out. Okay, there's no need for that. I need your I need You call me here. Go for a walk before you know, you know. Go, steady, goes like it's easy. It's not hard, you know. Again, there's no trickery. So
just whatever it is, it is. Okay, so don't don't overthink.
Yeah, I think i'm gonna what i'm gonna do, Jessica. I think I did that. I'm gonna release to you. I'm gonna Jessica. I'm gonna release. I can do that. I can g0 0ver, but I can release for you. So you can see what is right and wrong in there. Okay, that's one. I think it's best. So everybody can see right now. I'm gonna go in there, and i'm gonna i'm gonna let you guys.
I'm gonna let you.

Feb 28

"Hello, folks! Do you guys see me just by any chance? And do you hear me?
Is it clear because I am talking to you folks from a hotel, and the Internet here does not look very good.
Okay, Thank God, I was like, oh, my goodness! So
okay, folks! Hello, Everybody again. Very nice, seeing you. Did. You guys have a good reading week? I made sure to put that cat in there for you guys to make sure that you look at. Okay.
at least in this course is under control. So
do you guys? Was it everything good with you people? Did you get to get a little bit. Did you get to to have a little bit of rest, at least, or or not so much?
Yeah, Emma was relaxing. Good! This is good people, because
you know, get so else. Yeah, I understand, too. Some people are busy, but like I i'm happy that some of you managed to relax a little bit, because
you know, you need that extra strength to, you know. Let me see.
Joy was very busy. May see.
Yeah, okay, Good break from school, right like. Oh, oh, Valence is like, okay, Another thing to do.
Okay, Lots of okay, 50, 50 lots of okay. This is good. Yeah, Some people tired. Okay, people I was. I took a break from teaching, but it was very easy.
very, very busy. So anyways. But now i'm back.
So okay, so i'm gonna just so. You know you don't have to be concerned about the exam. You guys did over all well, and i'm gonna release the marks tonight. I'm gonna be. I'm gonna have off hours, and right after off hours i'm gonna give it a final look and just open the marks for you.
And and but I won't release the questions just yet, because I have a a few people taking the exams to. So you know. So no no questions yet, but as soon as everybody is done I will release the questions for you as well.
Is that okay? Clear? So tonight you're gonna get your mark back. And and yeah, and we're let's see if today we can talk about the assignment which is due by the end of it's dual. I can't even remember the the do date, but I think it's neck. It's Napole right like, yeah, it's in April. But we let's get started with that.
Another thing that I would like to tell you
is that I am Well, I'm talking to you folks from Manitoba Winnipeg.
So the connection here I am at a hotel.
The connection here is not great, in fact, the connections terrible. So you you'll hear me well, right like, cause I was like
I was freaking out about today's class, because I like what? If you know, they can't hear me. Well, you know whatever. So you hear me. Okay, because even like for me to do my slides. I was doing them Sunday night, and I was like.
you know, like I add a lot of pictures in my slides right, and I couldn't add them, because it takes whatever for Powerpoint to search through the images.
So, as I call me, and you know, I won't. Have you know. Anyways, it's just bad connection. I don't know if it's to the hotel. I don't know if it's the service here in the area. I don't know, but it's just not good. I even complain downstairs.
But okay, another thing. Before we start
Thursday this Thursday. I am very sorry to tell you that i'm going to have to pre record our lecture.
And the reason why is just because I have a presentation to do.
Yeah, it's March thirtieth. You're right. Rear: yeah, it's March thirtieth last day of this month of next month for me. It's starting tomorrow, so you have like 30 days to do it.
which should be fine. So we're gonna let's talk about that today.
And so next this Thursday I won't. Be able to to teach live because i'm gonna be in upstate New York doing a presentation in there. So I have. I'm here in Winnipeg. Actually, today i'm just in between flights, you know. So
So i'm just waiting for My! I I had to do something yesterday, here and then today. I am, you know, in a hotel working, and then tomorrow morning, and catch my fly to Montreal, and then i'll drive to, you know, upstate New York, and then do my presentation there. So Thursday is my presentation day.
so it's gonna take like pretty much a whole day event. So anyways I won't be able to to be with you folks, and and i'm sorry because I I I don't really enjoy pre-recorded lectures. I mean, I I miss kind of having, you know
you guys here so but anyways i'll have to do that, Lily, where it's gonna be in Plattsburgh. I don't know if you heard about this place. There's a school there called Sunni Plotsburg. It's from the
New York State system. So I'm going to give them a talk
on on surveillance work, actually, and in mental health
like so, anyway. So i'm gonna do the talk. Do Have you been there. Lily Plottsburg. Are you familiar with the area? I've never driven in there?
Oh, okay, so what's okay? Yeah. Anyways, Tell me what city I have never driven to that area over there. But i'm gonna take. I'm gonna rent a car and just drive because I I saw that. Okay, okay, I I here. It's just like an hour from Montreal I I saw on Google Maps, so you know.
and the flight is just horrible, because I would have to fly to New York and then go up like 5, 4 h. It's just like easier to try to monitor out, and, you know, get a rental car and drive there.
So let's see. But anyways, people any questions, any concern, anything you want to say before we start
any questions again for those of you who just arrived exams the marks are gonna be up tonight. You won't be able to see your your questions yet just yet, because I still have people taking the exams, so I don't want to release the questions. But you're gonna be able to see them, you know.
And then, Valencia, i'm gonna release that to you. I I all honestly. I cannot remember
by heart, because it's just too much going on. What. But I I do remember that I checked, and I do remember that was good.
I didn't check the the the percent I checked, like, you know, like the like, because I think we had 65 questions or 55. Anyways, I can't remember if I say something. Here's gonna be wrong. So it's just too. Much going on people. But I you i'm gonna send you an email saying the press average was this: the Median? Was that the minimum and the maximum score was this: so you, you're gonna know this like sharply, like in a
You know, we're gonna finish this class. I'm: going to host off hours and then i'm gonna release the marks to you. Okay.
prepare that Luther email and and and send it to you.
So if I knew I would say it here. But I just want to say, and then it's wrong. But
any question any concern people
feel free to to put in here. Okay, i'm going to start. We're going to you guys, You guys, go as
let's just we're gonna finish
last class because I stopped in the middle of the way like we didn't finish the powerpoint set, so I still have a few slides to cover a few ideas to share with you, and then we're going to do something else. So, people
last time, I hope you can see my slide. I hope that you know that is, Hold on. I'm just duplicate this.
Oh, not this one here, this one.
Okay. So we are doing this slide here. Okay, that is, is Richards article, which a little bit of this article appeared in the exam now and then, like you know, the rest of it is gonna be in the final, and i'm gonna finish what we started. So I stopped
when we met a last time I we were doing those slides in here, and I was telling you I just want to recap a little bit very quick. I will tell you, and let me know if you don't see my slides. Okay, because I'm assuming that you see the slides.
But I I Well, I told you last time we met that surveillance. He has this ability ability to be in personal
so overall. But people flag you at the airport. Yeah, they do but like. But the whole mechanics of it, the mechanical part of surveillance is
in personal. I mean it doesn't target one specific
person. It targets a classification
like it doesn't it doesn't target. Sorry. Let me just rephrase this. It does not target a person.
It doesn't target Marcella. It targets, You know, people who have
who who have specific features or like like a specific specific that that full feel specific criteria.
So oh, you know Latin America. Okay, because there's drugs coming from there, or you know, or you know, or you know someone who is a frequent flyer, because it's weird. I mean you. You fly that much, especially if you're not in business class. So why you're flying so much, and you're not reach so like you know they they they put like models in there that you know. In the end it targets you. I mean it. It's me that gets pulled out, but like. But the mechanics of that, it's not like, oh, i'm gonna target Marcella. No.
And then the system works in a way that they guard. The officer sees and say, oh, okay, like this person's application, and then they, you know. And then it goes through
human discretion. Right? So. And then it's up to me. The guard. Oh, okay.
You know, this person fits the profile, and and then this person has a darker skin, or or this person is is too white. Here doesn't belong in here, so it's like you know it's up to the guard to. Do you know, like that kind of final touch? Okay.
let me just see the the chat here.
So it's that. Yeah, it's exactly jazz. It's the that it's the data set right. It's like that's why we talk about big data. I mean, in the algorithm so you know, so racial profile is in personal. Because this is Valencia You're saying because it is the race that are. You get Exactly. You got it. Okay, so it's not like it. Doesn't. Go for
a person he goes for a type. Right? So keep this in mind. So that's why. Because otherwise here you might, that this slide can mislead you, and you can all. But that's not, you know. So I need you to understand what it's actually saying. You know it goes for population.
Okay? And here's where it stopped. Actually, so
surveillance people.
I mean. The purpose of surveillance is to classify you. You know you know this better than I do. You got it right that you classify you? Monitor. Why do you monitor? Why do you? You know you collect information? Because you're going to produce classifications? You're going to govern with that
right? So that's what we do with surveillance surveillance tools. So so it, you know, so like it's a in a sense, surveillance produces the stereotypes. It puts people in boxes. Right? So me I am from Latin America, like you know, an area that exports cocaine to the world.
Brazil is of a Brazil Doesn't produce a lot of cocaine, but it's a root of cocaine. So a lot of Brazilians. They are used as mules to carry cocaine and their bodies. So that makes me so. I check that box right so like, you know. So there's a so I feed the stereotype. I am a woman.
So now I mean, like in the past, the mules the people are carrying the drugs. They used to be men, but now they are going for women. They're going for older people. They're going for pregnant women so like. So I I check another box. I fly a lot. I check another box, so it's like, so you know, and then I fit that stereotype.
Therefore I am seen as a risk, so I have many, much more chances. If you travel with me and you. You are a Canadian passport.
you know. I mean I I. If we do exactly the same, we behave in exactly the same way. I have more chance of getting pulled out, and you know, and asked for a private interview, or or for a PET now than you. And there's also more chances that they're gonna select me for, you know, for for for swap my things and see if I have cocaine, you know. Swap my money, swap my hands, because usually money is a very. They always swap money because money, you know, for people who deal with cocaine and staff dealers they use a lot of
cash and cash straight. It has a traces right. So so I I feed that that that stereotype so
and in in here
is oh, sorry.
The problem is that again, you have the data. You have the data set. You have the system telling you. Look, this is the risk. This person is a risk, but I mean, and then it's up to the official, the employee, or the surveillance worker, the person who does the surveillance. Like
you know, they they employ the human Who is there watching to kind of interpret the data right? So like, because
the for us, we don't work with that. So
I mean, we don't, you know what. But when you start to work, and we if you work, for example, airports or places where there's a lot of crowds you get used to.
You know. You get used to kind of, you know, kind of analyzing people analyzing people's behavior.
I probably you've seen those shows. Do you know those shows in airport security. I don't know, like you know, they used to be. I don't know if they this to exist, because I don't have TV anymore. But you know those shows that you know they they they check like people arriving Toronto in big airports in the world and in how the guards they kind of. Oh, I can tell that that person is, you know.
yeah board security kind, that kind of stuff, you know. So you know. Yeah, so it's
it's so they can. They can tell right, because they they watch behaviors. They see patterns and things. They're very nuanced
that the machines that the artificial intelligence doesn't capture that. So so you so it's crucial in here. I would like to take you your memory back to that article that we read about how surveillance, like surveillance and feminism.
and we discussed. I remember we had very good conversations with Matthew and other people in this class that we talked about it's about social norms, right? So if you are a guard an officer that you you are, you have this more kind of
you know you you didn't. You didn't do proper training, and you believe that you are kind of on the kind of more conservative side of the spectrum, and you don't really like immigrants. Or you don't really like specific categories of of people or specific scheme callers, or a specific Really, ge religions. So you kind of you know, you are more inclined to kind of have carry on more bias inside of your final interpretation. But if you are well trained.
because, you know, training is a very powerful thing people, you know, and it's like we talk about training later. But, like you know, if you are well trained, even if you you have those tendencies that can be kind of discriminatory. You are going to be able. You're going to have the ability to say, oh, you know
you're going to be able to go after the right target. Not like You're not going to let your bias You're going to have bias to, but you're going to be more effective with your bias right like with your with your decision, not your bias, but you're going to be more effective with your decision. So
this is really really important. So training, you know. train is, is it is If extra I was actually, I was going to avoid this topic today, but i'm gonna getting there. Since you guys are all here, we have a lot of people in class. So look
me, I am someone who is steady public safety.
and I study, and I come from the surveillance background, and I see I see police people. I see correctional officers. I see firefighters as
as surveillance surveillance agents. That's how you see them. Because what is the job of a police officer? You're monitoring you're monitoring. And then oh, there's a problem. You go in there. You know. What is it that correctional officer Does they monitor? They monitor people. They take care of people to take care of People means to watch people.
So right? So that's what they do. They do surveillance work.
and and when I see cases, and I see that a lot in my research cases of
correctional officers abusing emails or prison residents. That would be the proper appropriate name prison residence. When I see that in my research.
obviously, I think that the person who is
harassing, bullying, abusing, violating, committing a crime against someone must be investigated, investigated, and punished according to the law. That's my view on the individual level. This is the individual level
on a social level.
When I see cases that correctional officers are abusing prison residents.
I immediately what comes to my mind. So one side comes, okay, individual. This person got to be investigated and punished on the other side of my mind it comes.
Where is training?
I see it as a problem of training.
So that's why i'm emphasizing here like for for surveillance, to work and to work in a just
fair manner. We need training. We need those people who are in charge of surveillance to have a lot of training, especially regarding racism. You know violence, abuse, harassment. They need to understand the challenges that each population face each popational group
face, you know, so they need that training. So I obviously so. I, the person should be, you know, like investigate, but on the flip side I blame the organization. I go like.
What is it that correctional service? Canada, the provinces are, you know, if it's a State, a state, a a provincial prison, or a Federal prison, I mean, I ask this training and recruitment
it. It's not working because you are recruiting people that you know that is mistreating others when their job is not to do that
right or or you are you you you you would recruit to them, and then you did not provide proper training. You did not teach them that. Look that you are a public servant. You're not here to, you know, to to do justice with your own hands. You are here, you know, to carry on the orders of the state, the sentence right? So it's like.
So I don't know if you guys understand what I'm saying. I am bringing this up because it's an invitation for you, because especially now we see a lot of like a police violence. We see a lot of like violent, with violence inside of prison abuse of of prisoners. This is something very old.
obviously also police violence is old. But now we are talking about that. We're you know we we are. We are becoming increasingly intolerant, and I think that we are right. We cannot accept.
But but I question, okay. That police person needs to be. you know.
prosecuted. But how about training? What is the train that they're getting, you know, to shoot someone that just because you know that person, you know, like you know, did not react in in the way that they that they were expecting that that person would react, and I and I bring this discussion in here from this lens
the surveillance, I mean, because they are surveillance workers. So let me see here.
Jessic, is it possible that because some people believe in the out, the algorithms hold absolutely No, by as it's used to. Yeah, no look. But first of all, they do have buyers because we make them right. So we we can make even like
there is bias, for example, in those algorithms just be let's just trade this careful here, Jessica. There is bias. So algorithms, they say, look Latin American people, especially Columbia, Brazilian. I mean, they are. They are. They are connected to cocaine. That's what the algorithm. Says, because someone fit that information, there is this unfair yeah, it is because obviously
like it's just like a little fraction of like a tiny, teeny, teeny fraction of the Colombian Society or Brazilian society that is actually, you know, involved in trafficking, but it it creates a super. So there is bias.
but they do that, and and then they make okay, how do we go about this, because at the same time we need to create some sort of system. You know that you know that captures, you know, like
people who are actually the traffickers like the trafficking and the who are trafficking drugs. But yeah to me, the person who is actually implementing
we need some this fine tuning. and in many cases that fine tuning is not there.
because I mean the the algorithm, is math. It's math and math is 0, or one
it's binary. It's is, or it's not
right like there's not like in in between, or you know what I mean. So so there is bias in there.
But the problem so much is not the bias in there. But the problem is that, you know, like many cases, the people who are interpreting
like that information that the algorithm is feeding back. They don't have the skills to interpret that in kind of a new ones that a little bit I don't know. If that is, is it? Is it clear, Jessica?
Yeah. So Matthew George Floyd. what that those officers did
Exactly. They They thought that they were using the proper proper techniques. And
well. I I well, I
I don't know if they thought so, but I I know that they said that you know they said that whatever, and I also don't. I didn't follow the court transcripts. I did watch a lot of it like on TV, but I didn't follow the whole thing. But yeah, but let's suppose that you're right. It still doesn't really matter if you know what matters is like that procedure was wrong.
So okay on individual level, they like they are already like. They were sentenced, 2 of them, like like the like, the the main person who was stepping on the neck, and the other person was watching. They're both sentenced, I think even there's a third person now waiting for for sentencing. He's gonna be sentenced to. But but I I see, and of course, and this is what needs to happen. But on the flip side
it's it's useless to pinpoint to pinpoint. Look, you killed George Floyd. Okay, yeah, he did, and he's in jail. But we need to change training.
Otherwise we're gonna have another jar, Floyd: Every year, every month, every day. We're gonna have someone dying. Right so. And that's the point here. So surveillance can be very dangerous, and it is quite often, because in specially we don't, we don't have the proper training. But this is an invitation for you.
you know, to kind of think about this because i'm probably you haven't talked about that you know that those killings police feelings. They are actually an occupational health and safety problem. It's like, you know.
It's. It's an occupational like for fault like flawless or you know it's something wrong with like the way that they trained.
Oh, yeah, Valencia, Empathy training
and proper training. For example, if you're going to be a police officer in Canada.
You need to understand. I mean. I am here. You will. You pack people?
You know Winnipeg is the most violent city in Canada is the most violent seed in Canada.
and when you go to certain parts of the party, sorry I've been talking another language this day, so it's like. So when you go to another, when you go to certain party parts of those, the city.
you see poverty and it's everybody's indigenous. Sorry it's a social problem right here.
So you you have to be careful. You have to have you have to understand
where this came from. You have to kind of have train your indigenous studies. You need to understand Canada's call on your past. You need to understand the violence that has been perpetrated about indigenous people. You need to understand Canada's history, how this country came to become a country, and how you know parts of the the the population that was here, the indigenous people. They were like, violated and and oppressed. I mean, you need to. You need to understand that. And and okay.
Oh, but I I I am a racist. Okay. But look, you need to understand. If you don't understand this, I can't hire you simple as that.
Oh, but i'm not gonna change your okay, you know. Maybe you're gonna keep your beliefs inside of your heart. But you you absolutely. That cannot come through because or you that cannot become like an issue on the streets when you're dealing with the population, because your job is not to to, to, to
to mistreat anybody. Your job is to see. Okay, someone did something wrong. You're gonna put that person, you know, in the car, and you're gonna take that person to the police station. And then you, you know you're gonna have to fall procedures. You can't just say you know right so. But it's I work with police as well. People in Ontario, and I can tell you is stigma. It's it's high, and people don't want to discuss. I mean.
anyways. Law enforcement is a very encapsulated kind of organization that it's really hard to change, and even for people who come they are Well, I'm going a little bit on an off a tangent here, but like
a lot of the officers who join the service.
They and they have like fresh ideas because a lot of them, they do a a a criminology degree, a criminal justice degree, and they are arriving there, and they suffer miserably.
You know they're called newbies, and they get all sorts of harassment until they kind of
get to and up, which means until they kind of start to kind of
like, you know, act in a without empathy, just to just put it in a nice way.
you know. I don't know I is it? Is it making sense to you folks? Are you guys following here?
Yeah. Okay. Good.
So so people again. Ha! When we, when we let's put ourselves in the shoes of surveillance workers.
so our interpretation is always
partial. So we, you know we have to go in there, and we have to kind of you know
we we have to for us to go from partial
to something more holistic and understand what's going on with the person instead of just, you know, being aggressive, we need you. We need to
talk to that person. We need to exchange with that person right? So and so we have to be careful. So what I'm putting this slide here is like this is what you should not do.
What? What? What like surveillance worker should not do. They should not be partial. They should go and talk to the person, understand the context. They should, you know they should they should rely, they should be aware that they do have preconceptions, and in pre-existing knowledge that that knowledge is not always the truth.
So they have to be careful, you know, not to rely on those pre-existent knowledge, and and they have to be aware that they have bias people all of us. We have bias on on something right, so we always have bias because we don't know everything. We don't know everybody. We don't know everything in the world, so we need to acknowledge that.
And especially if we're gonna work with surveillance we have to be, and that that would be part of the training like the train, you would have to tell them. Look.
all of us. We have bias. It's okay to have bias. But what is not okay is to get that by, as in you know, and use that to oppress people. So you need to be aware of that right. So
So if surveillance efficient. not necessarily, it can be efficient. It can be efficient. And I would like to site here. I have a colleague. She did her Phd. At the
and she created an algorithm like a model to predict crimes in Edmonton.
So she used surveillance
to create a model that would predict crimes in advance. Very, very nice work.
So but you know for that to be efficient.
I mean you can't just follow. You know the model you have to interpret the results. So a lot of her fees, is she? She was sharing with me that I like the the hardest part of her. Thesis is not to create the model per say, that's easy. That's math that for people who know math that's easy
and artificial intelligence and computers easy. But the problem is, you know, how do you make sure that that model is not gonna be used to, you know, to reproduce racism, to reproduce discrimination to reproduce oppression against specific types of people. Right? So that's the that's the point
like until they kind of fall in line with the officers I didn't get here. Jenna enlightened me, please. I i'll go back to your just give me more because I didn't get. I think I missed what I said when you said that, so i'm lost here. But, like you know, go back in there, please.
So people
the relationship between those who are those who watch and those who are watch it.
It can be a very
conflictual, adversarial
relationship.
but it also can be a relationship. That is, it's liberating. That is truly for people, safety, not for oppressing, not for oppression.
So that's the point. So I would like you to always keep this in mind if you ever work with surveillance. If you ever decided you're gonna work with like any organization that does surveillance. It's always crucial to think about those who are watching and those who are watch it and their relationship, and what kind of training, what kind of you know, resources are in place to ensure that their relationship is a constructive, a constructive relationship, not a relationship of oppression.
Oh, yeah, you got it. That's exactly that they do, they call it. Oh.
I what my talk yesterday was actually about that was like how the older officers, not older in in in age, but, like in in tenure, dropped in your like. How the old officers, how they make the lives of those new officers, big police officers or correctional officers, miserable.
miserable, and in and that's like a lot of the people that I interview in there like first one year of work, when they complete By the time that they complete one year in the service. Like police or corrections, they want to drop out because they they they're just. They are being abused, and also just curiosity for you.
If you're curious right now, as you're watching me, Google
Edmonton Institution, which is our prison in that need to maximum security for men. We also have the Admin. And for women admitted institution for women by Google, the one admin institution. And in just like, in just Google abuse, employee abuse and a unfortunately in admin them in our home
we have this reason: where we have had the most
terrible horrible cases of employee on employee abuse, including sexual assault.
Okay. So if you're just Google and you're gonna find a lot of newspaper articles if you want to go deeper into this.
You also can check the reports from the correctional investigator of Canada.
because the situation so bad, like the correctional investigator, they're not supposed to take care of. Like
like staff relationship, they just take care of emails like whatever happens to prison residents, but because of the of the the abuse, is so so awful obscene in admitting that.
like now the Ombudsman, like the correctional investigator, they are pressurizing corrections to to improve the the workplace, you know, for for for staff. So it's. It's awful people, you know. I don't know if you've heard about those things I mean, i'm bringing your prison society to you so anyways.
So surveillance people has many sides. And now I think you are kind of getting that because you did well in the exam. So.
and it feels that you are. You know you You got it so
it can be pre modern meaning, like old, just like when you do surveillance without any kind of technology tools like just like your naked eyes, because, like the panoptic, and that is kind of
it's an old kind of surveillance. There's no like cameras or anything. It's just like a person, a power watching everybody. Right? So that's that. It can be pretty modern in this sense. I mean no technology, or it can be like even like. Go back to the Bible time, where you know you're just watching people you are doing surveillance on them.
or it can be some authors, then they're going to say no. It is also modern in the sense that
it leads you. If it it it makes you be self aware it makes you be kind of more reflexive about who you are in your identity, and and so that in that sense is modern. Why? Because it coincides with the that idea of the CD. Where you become this individual where you walk around and you have anonymity. Nobody knows who you are, but you know everybody, and you think about yourself. So it's modern in that sense, or some authors, they say, can be post modern, like the loose, like you know. Hagery.
with his surveillance assemblage, you know. So it's this control that never stops it's it's nearly impossible for you to hide. So that's it. Okay, so
that's where we stop here for we finished last class. I'm: just check the chat.
So okay. So when you're talking about watching watchers, does it only mean like prisoners being. No, no, no, it means it means, anyway it it. It could be me watching you in the exam, and you knowing that you are being watched
right like it's the same like it's the same. I mean. One thing is like, Imagine people. Okay, let's bring this to us. Imagine if I tell you, folks.
Look.
i'm going to be watching you guys, and if you do anything.
i'm gonna give you a 0. Imagine if I said that to you.
you would be, what how would you feel if a profit tells you that?
Look if the or let's make it more kind of okay. I gave you a very dramatic example. Let me give you a more kind of like, more realistic example. But off tells you. Look, if you're flagged.
it's a 0. How would you feel about that? Tell me.
Come on, people. Where are you guys? How would you feel if a Prof. Tells you you are flagged, therefore 0 for you.
Yeah, I would be terrified. I would be angry. I would be pissed. I would be panicky. I would be like stressed as hell. I would be self conscious I would be like being on my pants, but I would like, you know, not going to washroom. I would probably fend during the exam, because I mean, I would be so like in like in panicky, and and
it would be like awful. It's oppression.
But how about like different? They tell you. Look. people please enjoy like, you know, don't get nervous
if anything happens. I'm gonna watch the tape, and then i'm gonna see what's going on in there, and if there's anything that I find suspicious, I am going to contact you.
and and you don't have to worry about it, you know. Just make sure that you're not doing anything stupid, You're not cheating. You're not checking, You know your cell phone like, you know, for cheating. You're not, I mean. And then
and I'm going to talk to you before anything. How do you feel? You feel like, okay.
you know. Okay, I I You know I don't know if I can trust this woman yet, but I will. I will, you know. right? So you're going to be more like relaxed. You're going to be like right, so
you're gonna be. Oh, my gosh, I need to. I really need to be okay. I'm gonna go. P: You know. I'm gonna tell Marcelo I need to be, you, you know, like so it's it's fine, right? So so look it's all about
It's not about the surveillance per se, because you guys knew that you were under surveillance. I knew that I was watching you. We all knew, but it's about the relationship. It's about us. It's how we relate.
So I could. I could have used that to oppress you.
you know, or I could have use that to have a more equal balanced relationship where, you know. Okay, you know it's th. That's the rule. But you know, I mean, nothing is gonna happen unless I mean, I I actually do something wrong purposely, which is usually not the case. You guys get what I'm saying. Is it clear now, Valencia and everybody?
It goes well. It goes both ways right that look in the panopticon in the panoptic, and it goes one way, because.
like the like, the people, they don't know when they are being watched.
Right so but I. And then you have to be context 12 valence. Yeah. Because here, in in like, in in today's society, you know that you're being Watch it right? So that's a little bit of a difference, like you know. I mean you don't know where it's coming from, but you know.
in the particular case of the exam. You also knew that you're being watched, because you know you know I I told you, and the University has this. Oh, thank God! This transparency policy that tells you, you know. And you know all this. This is this context.
But I also couldn't make an argument like, for example, you know, sometimes you know your telephone may be watching you when you don't know that right? Because not always the the corporations they tell us, and I am confident, and I also know from reading the literature on surveillance that people who do specific research on how a Google surveillance and another platform surveillance surveillance. I mean, we know that sometimes we are being surveilled without knowing.
and that becomes an issue. So so you have to analyze the contacts. But in in this context here it's it's you know it's. You know that I am watching you and and but the thing is that you you are. You know that you're being watched, but you don't you. You cannot watch me back right like so.
So there is always an in power in balance of power, because I mean I was watching you, but you were not watching me back.
so there is a little bit of a an option here, even in the example. No, like you. You knew that you're being watched, but you could not watch me back. So there is a little bit here, right of the panoptic. And just see here.
So, Jessica, you would feel better dealing with a person. Rather, they are a vague Yes, exactly exactly, because you you believe it's almost like because we tend to believe in humanity, right like we believe that.
you know. If it's a human, that person is not, which is not always true. But we we tend to believe that if it's a human, you know, we're gonna be. You know things are gonna do. Well, right? So
yeah. But but so, you guys, I mean.
we the after this course, taking this course, I hope that you're going to be much more aware of surveillance. So you always have to analyze the context, and when you analyze the context is important for you
to to to observe. Okay. like who is watching, who is being watched? How is their relationship
Is the people who are watching like is the people being watched it aware that they are being watch. It is the people who are being watched. It able are they able to look back and and watch? So because that's where the power relationships happen.
Right? So I think the class example here is is the best one like using the the Our exam surveillance.
So let me. Just
those who are in power are usually being watched in the public eye through that you see. So you're getting. You're getting the nuances like, you know, like the like, the layers, because I mean it's complex, right. So if you become popular.
people are gonna watch you so. But yet yet you're gonna have more money to have privacy. You're gonna make more. Have more money to, you know. So it's like, so you can control that or your privacy for very powerful. So you know there's like it's all so it's like the whole goal here, and I I it. From your comments I can see that i'm achieving. It is like
that. You start to see surveillance as something very complex that involves power involves social norms is not something that you know. Oh, surveillance is good or surveillance is bad, or I don't care about surveillance, because I have nothing to hide. It's much much bigger than that, right? So
oh, you see, Jessica, this is not okay, because that's the problem in you know, in in in like, in in a country like Canada, where our human rights are very advanced in terms of like the legal human rights framework.
It's not okay for you to be, you know, like to have cameras people need to know, and when we talk not today. But when we talk about workplace surveillance, i'm gonna talk about for Mick Murray with you guys, and how people are being watched in work camps in there, and it's kind of a hit them, you know, like the employers. They don't tell
the extent of surveillance, and i'm i'm gonna share with you. You're gonna laugh because it involves like toilet drains. It involves garbage. It involves all sorts of crazy things, even like housekeepers. You know that they are working as
even like the housekeepers. They're working at surveillance agents without knowing that they are being there being used to that purpose. But anyways, that's going to be for another another lecture. So let me just share with you my next Powerpoint.
This one here can close.
Okay. So this is the one
it's nice. Seeing you folks. I I actually missed. I I missed you. Okay, so let's just see, I don't need this.
Hold on, people. Something's happening here on my side of the screen. That's why
I didn't share yet.
Oh, man. stop, share sure again.
Okay.
Okay, now, it's coming.
Okay. So okay, we have one more article to discuss today. Okay. And then we're going to wrap up this whole section about classification.
And then we're going to move to something else. So look. This is the article called Visibility as Resistance
by Muslim Americans in a surveillance and security atmosphere.
Okay.
So we're going to talk about being Muslim in the United States. This is a very well written article you're going to see when you're reading it. Is that easy? Read. So please read, read as soon as you can this you're going to read this in your sleep. It's a very easy, well written
article by a very young scholar. She's great, and she is at the University of Toronto. Okay, so I believe, because of the way that she talks in the article that she did her peach in the United States.
Now she's a pro at University of Toronto, so her name is Cassine Shams.
So maybe i'm mispronouncing her name. But so, and and she has this article that i'm sharing with you. And she did this article. People when she was she was a student, and she benefited from her experience as a student.
you know, on campus and and and was it it's really interesting, really Well done. You're gonna see. She's like. She's very honest about her work. Very kind of clean work, beautiful work, in my opinion, high quality research. So look before I get to her.
Let me just share with you very quickly, and I'm going to need your participation here. People imagine.
Let's let's work with 2 scenarios. Okay.
First, let's think about rural area. Is there anybody here in this class? I mean, feel free to you, Don't. Have to identify or anything I mean, you don't have to participate. But like, is there anybody who would like to say something or who has have?
Oh, man, I I should be teaching French today like anybody who anybody who has experience in the countryside.
or who has lived or was born in the countryside. I was. Is there anybody else here? And and I would like to ask about how is life in the countryside.
and and probably if you, if you are like me, and you know the countryside. Oh, the chat is okay. Okay. So you'll help me here. So I've okay. I I grew up in countryside Brazil and you guys help with Canada part. So
my countryside was like, you know, people, they were very much the same caller. Okay.
my caller, like lifestyle, very similar. You know a lot of them. The the the husband, the father of the family. Very, very, very heterosexual. Okay, very heterosexual in Brazil, very white in my neighborhood over there.
like, you know, man. They would work, you know, like, run the farm, and they their women, their wives. They would go, you know, work in the city. That was the case for my mom, for example, and and the kids, you know they would, you know, go to a school like nearby in the in the edge.
you know of the the farm in the you know the city and the rural areas and very uniform life. Very kind of, you know. Everybody pretty much the same, even like in terms of thoughts. I remember that you know all those crowds that you would. We would all go to church together. We I come from a Catholic background in Brazil. So we would go to the Catholic Church.
and we would know each other and my grandfather. He had a lot of friends. They would come for barbecue on Sunday after church, you know, and they would, and they would talk politics. They they! They had exactly the same politics. They all belong to the same party. They had exactly the same opinions, and that was pretty much my, you know, like childhood life, you know. Let's see If is that like kind of what you guys saw, you know for those of you who you know kind of very
similar, very, you know, very pat patterned kind of life. Is that what you saw for those of you? So
you know, mesa here saying very little diversity. Yeah, definitely mine, too. There was no foreigners, no people for different texts, and even like Brazilians, everybody had the same accent, Portuguese accent.
Anything outside? Oh, yeah, Anything outside would be noticed. I love this because I had a peck of. I have a I had a pack of. I had a pack of dogs like I. I used to have 4 or 5 dogs, and and they were like not like that in the same, in the sense that we have pads. Now that we
they were living outside the house. They had their little house, and you know they were like, and they would bark anything weird that they didn't know any weird person they would bark, and they knew everybody. They knew all the family friends, and you know, so they would behave. If there is something strange. The the animals they would know they would be the first one to alert
and then. And we also would, you know someone like I remember me as a kid people walking by the road, like you know, and I would be playing around with my bike, and I would see people like, you know, walking like on foot. I'd say this is weird. I mean, you know this person doesn't belong in here, and immediately I would tell my father or someone you know like.
So that was, I think, was pretty much the same right? Like, yeah, as I spent time in rural. Your whales. Okay.
Call: yeah, exactly. Homo homogenous baby routines like repetitive. Exactly so, you sociology people. We have a bunch of names to describe this. I'm not. I don't need to use the sociology jargon here, because I mean, you know, not everybody sociology, and that doesn't really matter what matters that? You guys get it? So look
in that context. Anyone who has an accent becomes deviant, deviant, meaning deviates from the
because that what the norm was one type of specific accent. The norm was one color. The norm was one way of, you know, going to dressing the norm was one specific religion and one specific church, You know. The norm was that all the kids they would go to one school.
So that was the norm. Right so. and then think about urban area.
It's completely opposite, right like you get people from all over. Of course it depends on the size of the city. If you're talking about the small town, it's gonna be more like countryside for talking about Big City is gonna be more like big cities. So, so
essentially is the more human people you have together, the more diversity.
you know. So city is a place of diversity, and I covered that before in in one of the lectures. Right? So city is this modern modern modern place that you know everybody's different that we are used to different things, you know. So in the norm. Look in in the city
I just see the chat.
We had a mob mob MoD mentality sometimes once police. Oh, okay, yeah, interesting. And but but still so. The norm probably was to have that kind of mentality right? It doesn't matter in that community. That was the mentality. So that was the norm.
Everyone knows, you know. Yes, there was, you know
there was this this part, too, you know, because you know each other. And here's like a an Anita. Let me tell you something. Here's something important.
a lot of in the beginning, like earlier on in criminology we we tend. We used to believe that, like the crime rates
in rural areas, they're they're slower. And indeed, when we look at crime rates in rural areas. They're much lower. You don't get like, you know, people stealing because everybody knows each other. But the point here is that
the problem is not. It's not if I just want to make this comment for you guys to think about it's not like. If rural areas they have more or less crime, and if they feel safer or like less more or less safer. The problem is that in rural areas we have other kinds of crimes. Other kinds.
I invite you to think about this a little bit. So in in rural areas where everybody knows each other.
a lot of the crimes they go silenced like victims. They silence.
and they're the the the the perpetrators of those crimes. They also, you know. They make sure that you know that everybody's silent about it, and quite talked, and involves a lot of family violence. So we have family violence in the city and in the countryside, for example. But the difference here is that the likelihood.
the likelihood that a crime we will be found out. We will be found. We will be discovered
in the countryside is much lower, because you have that cohesion in the society. So people don't really share, and that means that crimes can get really ugly sexual out in the family. We can get really, really ugly. Actually.
I am going to. Oh, I have to send you this people. I need to send you this. I'm gonna send you an art. Why, I beg you to read it is from this little city in the United States and the family. They used to run the city, and they used to buy the the the people who do Judy duty like they. You know people who are the Judy.
and they had a lot of power and influence. And now and then, of course, a lot of crimes happened, and now, eventually, like someone in the family got caught. So this is, i'm gonna send you this article that I just saw like this is happening right now. The trial is going on in the United States.
I'm going to send you because it's help you to. It helps you to think about crime. And and you know small city, big cities. You know those kinds of things that we're talking about.
So
Yeah. So Macy here, talking about the graduate class, you know. Oh, yeah. So you you guys got what i'm saying. So look, I see here.
Okay, I see. So I see you, Jenna, saying that you know you had a lot of disparity which is interesting, but like, you know, but i'm sure that you also. So you had disparity, but, like, was it clear what was right and wrong, and like you know, do you still have like this kind of pattern life or not so much.
because, if not so much, which is fine. True, it's just an outlier, truly enough. Up, not liar, you know kind of
Well, that's
exactly Well, in yes, surveillance is more informal. It's mutual surveillance. You're very right.
Okay.
Exactly. You're right, Jessica. I see you guys, here. Yeah. Okay. So this is good. So look So the point that I of trying to make with this exercise is just for us to think of visibility here.
because, look. it's always important. So keep in mind
in every so sign like rural. Why use the example? So you guys could picture different kinds of society.
We have rules. and usually
like who whoever break that rule is a deviant person, and is usually punished.
not necessarily punished, but, like it's isolated. It's harassed it's bullied. So that's how it happens. So here comes my next idea for you. This is all ideas for us to think the text. Okay.
So
think about identity movements. We're having a lot of identity movements in society right now. I mean, I would say that since 19, like 2,000, there was like since the 2,000 and beginning of the 2,000 we see, like a huge increase in in in movements that are identity based
here in Canada, and also in the United States, and also in Europe, especially. Now. We also see that in developing countries, but it it kind of developing countries they are catching up with like what's happening, high income, high income countries. So
I would like to invite. You see, if you agree with this, if that makes you think I would like to invite you to think of the identity identity movements as a force
pushing norms to change. So it's almost like, okay. Oh. black lives. Matter? It's forcing
to change the norm to say, Look to be black is okay. You have to respect the Black life
and then
Lgbtq: 2 plus movements. Okay.
Lgbtq: 2 plus us. We are here, and we're going to stay here and we're visible, and we want to. You know we want we want to be seen, and
this is a push to change the norm, because the norm was very heterosexual, like right? So it's like, well, just men and women. This is right, and everything else is wrong. So now there is a huge movement. No, no, no.
like. We are also right. We we can. We are in the right to. We can be. Excuse me, we're gonna be. We're gonna be black. We're gonna be Lgbtq 2. We're gonna be indigenous. We're gonna be Muslims. We're gonna be Chinese. We're gonna be Asians. We're gonna be darker scheme. We're gonna we're gonna have an accent. We're gonna it's okay, right? So
So it's like it's almost like a push to change social norms, and that and then that explains a lot of the backlash, because it's for people who are very ingrained in their norms. You tell them. Look, we're going to change the norms. It's not easy
even for us we have. We might have our norms somewhere in our heads we have an arms, and if someone tells us, look, you've got to change your norms. It's not easy
for people, but still society moves out ahead. So in society is about changing arms always. So it's not easy. But people who have to accept accept, because, you know, lost changes and laws. They make
things more like, you know you have to tolerate, you have to live with, and you have to respect, or at least you cannot be brutal. You cannot use force against anyone. So that's kind of, you know. Do you see what i'm trying to say here? Do you agree? Do you see that you know social movements are trying to change norms.
and I just putting here norms for you. Just so, you kind of think about what i'm actually talking about. I'm talking about. You know rules of behavior that are usually formal. They're usually formal, and they govern our behavior. They government how they govern, how we behave in groups in societies.
Right? So do you guys see? Or no it. This is like almost. I don't get what you're saying. I don't agree feel free to disagree, you know, like
I would like to hear from you guys if that makes sense.
Oh, yeah, Matthew, that's exactly that, Alex Murdo. Right like, I don't know in English how you say, for in French would be multiple. But, Alex. Alex. Yeah, that's exactly his family. I'm gonna send you the article.
you know. So, yeah, as you guys, Melissa has, she agrees. I mean, do you guys see or no? I mean, like again. Honestly, people let's exchange things here. You know what comes to mind.
you know. and I'm gonna keep moving. But you you tell me okay. So look. Oh, man, this Can you see
this thing here didn't let me see. Oh, that this one I for it! It was so hard to transform these slides that my size they look horrible, you know. Anyways, let's talk about regardless. The content is in here because the Internet was so bad for those of you who came late.
I am in Winnipeg and the hotel here doesn't have a good Internet so I couldn't build up my slides because was taking forever to
to load the images, you know.
Yes, it does. Valencia norms once they become like, for example, like in the beginnings. Let's think about. Let's think about cannabis. That's the best example that I can give to you.
Cannabis used to be in the beginning was something horrible that you people would not never tolerate. It was like a big, huge drug.
Right? That I mean, that's that was an arm. And then slowly, slowly, that was changing.
So eventually.
you know, the norm became that you can use it occasionally here and there. Nobody is going to really
do anything.
And then it became like, you know, decriminalized. It was no longer a crime.
And then, you know. people start to use more and leisure and stuff like that, and then eventually became
became legal like. Now it's sold. You can actually go and buy it before I was. Okay. It's not a crime, but it's it's hard to find, you know. Now it became something that you buy. You going to store you buy. So the norm change it.
And right after the the norm came the law.
So there is always a delay. Okay, so there is always a delay. First you change the Norm society, and then we have the law. So before
Lgbtq 2 plus marriage was approved or same-sex. Marriage was approved in Canada
people first start to be okay. No, no. We have to accept. We have to accept. And then you know, more and more couples. They were more open about their relationships, and and they were sharing with neighbors and and friends, and then more and more, and all of a sudden, you know. Okay, now you can do common law. Okay, this is great.
And then a couple of years later. Okay, now, you can marry if you're same sex. So now it you know. So so, anyway. But the norm, usually the formal part changes before the formal, usually in most case. Okay.
So people, when we think about Canada before we get to the article. When we think about Canada.
the norm in this country, until, like, okay, when when the colonizers, the settlers arrived, there were basically all whites from France, from England, from Scotland, from the Uk. Let's make it Uk: France.
and pretty much, and they in all, we also crying a little bit of Russians. So they all came, but mostly from Uk.
Hey, Kane?
And they say, okay, this is our land. This is my country. Now we're gonna you know I I was given a land here. This is my land, Those people that are here indigenous people are gonna push them away. We're gonna change their behaviors. We're gonna, and that's that's what makes our colonial process. So so
I struggle because imagine, imagine I mean, try to put yourself for a second, the shoes of someone. You are there. You have your life, your mobile, you are moving, you're killing both fellows, you are, you, you know, gathering your fishy. You have your life, and all of a sudden bunch of people arrive, and they say, Look now, there is a new norm.
You have to comply.
The norm now is that you're not gonna be killing animals. You're not gonna be fishing. You're gonna be doing farm work. You're gonna be doing agricultural work. And the norm now is that for you to do agricultural work?
You know you need to put your your kids to school because you you probably won't. Learn how to do every cultural how to do farm, how to farm the land. But your kids they need to learn. So we're going to put them in school, and then i'm going to tell you. No, no, no, I mean no, I don't want that.
I'm not gonna put them in school. And then the government or the the people who arrived the new be, they say. Oh, you know. No, no! If you don't give your kids, i'm gonna take them away anyways, so it becomes the hope that was Canada's process right, so that it's like in a nutshell, but like
so it was very hard, because I mean the people. They brought the norms, and they tried to force those norms on the ground, and they tried to do it like initially. Okay, we were. This is an arm. Obviously nobody is going to follow right if you put me in another norm, and i'm not going to follow this norm, and then you force it. You use oppression right? So
so, anyway, so so can so in any ways like so indigenous people were press. And then, like the Norm became this European norm. and in that your appeal, Norm.
the the anyone who was not white was deviant. So if you do not have the white scheme which I don't. I have like the brownish kind of like chocolate. You're You're off the norm right? So that, simple as that. So let's think about Muslim now
in the United States. Okay, you, You're off the norm. But then there's a struggle because nobody go down. Nobody goes down. We fall fighting. So now you're gonna fight right? So you're gonna go like oh, no, I need to fight this thing so and that's the struggle. Okay. Now to the text, United states.
So this person.
the author here she's going to study this hyper visibility. And oh, and one thing that I forgot once you become this once you become the deviant in the countryside, you know, as the example of some of you, or you become the deviant somewhere deviant, meaning the person that breaks the norm.
you always get hyper visibility right? So hyper visibility.
So if I walk in any place where you know it's a bunch of people who don't have an accent, and I do have an accent immediately.
because I have an accent. I I get hyper visibility. People are gonna say, oh, she's not from here. It's it. They might not say. Usually people don't say anything. They're not gonna say. Oh, I see you're not from here. No, people are very kind, usually, but I am a 100% sure that they notice, they say, oh, she has an accent. She's not from here
right? Or and people might wonder. Oh, Where is she from, you know, or some people might say, oh, but you know, you know, and then people start to have things thoughts not. This is not like just thought. Where is she from? Or or some people might even say, oh, she doesn't belong in here, then it depends. Some people might have more aggressive
kinds of thoughts. But some people just like thoughts. Right so. But anyways I am. I have become deviant, and I have, so you have to associate deviance with hyper visibility
in hypervisibility. Most case that means hyper surveillance, right? Because you mean just like the example. That's why I spent some more time discussing like the context. So just like someone said, I think was Jessica. No, I can't remember who was it like
Macy? Maybe like, you know, when someone walks into your rural area.
you immediately can tell that they don't do all in there, and then you you immediately like the hyper visibility is on. It's almost like on off. It's on right. So so, anyway, so
in the United States, I mean United States is an immigrant country. I mean a lot of just like us here, too, but it it kind of became more colored or colorful, quicker than us here now in Canada 25%
of our population. They are born outside of Canada, 25 so in each 100 people in Canada, 25, of them. They are born outside of of Canada. You're just like me, and the likelihood they're they're going to be colored like me is much bigger, right? So it's like No.
So. But the United States had that much before, however. Still, I mean United States has always had a a a small.
a Muslim community.
But in the last 4 3 4 decades that community grew a lot
right so.
But still, if you are a Muslim in the United States, you're gonna still be a little bit deviant in this sense that I mean in a lot of the places. You're not going to be an arm, and you're gonna track attention. And and again there is this movement saying: No, no, no!
You have to accept us because we were born here, and we are Muslim, and now we we are here, going to stay here. So there is the you know, the identity movement trying to change the norm, which is a struggle so anyways hyper visibility.
So how can you avoid hypervisibility?
You have to blend in. That's if you want to avoid some people don't want to avoid something, or sometimes it's impossible to avoid. In my case, for example.
I mean
I If I am. If I don't, if I zip my mouth.
I maybe can pass. But as soon as I open up my mouth.
you know. like I get the visibility. and then I still can pass. I can. I could lie. Oh, i'm from Quebec
i'm I'm Canadian. I'm just French.
I could pass.
but still, like, if I am in, get back there's no passing, you know. Oh, I could. I could try to, I oh, i'm on the phone. But my English is not that natural? So you know they wouldn't kind of. So you guys get what i'm saying so you know. So how do we blend in, and if you think about for me it might be easier
because my outfits I don't have anything specific about my outfit that gives out that I am Brazilian, but Muslim people they do have in many cases, not in all case, but in many cases, so it's much harder for you to blend in much, much harder. And that's what is going to discuss in this article. So.
being a Muslim in the United States, and I like this article because it applies to Canada. So, being a Muslim in Canada, you enjoy immediately hyper visibility.
Right so. And now imagine
being a Muslim, you know, after 9, 11
when
when those those 14 and 1914, and I can't remember how many it was anymore. The people who did the plot, the attack on the World Trade Center. They were mostly from Saudi Arabia, and they were Muslim.
And imagine.
all of a sudden, like you are associated to
the nation's biggest enemy.
and that's what she's discussing. How how do you deal with this? Because you are hyper visible? It's very hard for you to to hide and for you to hide. It means to give out your identity.
It means that you're gonna. You're not gonna be able to pray, which is something very important for you. It means that you're gonna be able to cover your hair, which is something very important for you. It means that you're gonna have to behave, or you know, talk things that you know that you you won't be in a way that it's not really you. So it's like a complete detachment
of like. It's almost like getting yourself away from who you are. right. So so I'm: just so. Something here, People. Yeah, this slide, Anyways, I don't know
what happening here of this slide here. But let's let's because the information that is in here. It's in here. So I might even delete this slide. It was my confusion, because I was freaking out, trying to get my slides in order because I was working so, anyway. So think about
9 11,
their panic climate, you know. And then you know, all the sudden you were so. I mean, she says in the article, that the the Muslim community they were sort of invisible.
I don't I personally don't agree with her. I think that I mean. But this is me. Okay, my opinion, and i'd like to see your opinion. I think that the Muslim community. They have always been very visible, and they have always been a target of, like, you know, of of hatred, I mean in many many countries like, you know, in countries where they are not the norm.
So but I don't know, but she says that you know that was like socially invisible to being kind of socially hyper visible. So all of a sudden they became suspect of terrorism, and then she goes like, I don't know I actually I didn't know this. I learned this from this article between 2,002 and 2,011.
The United States. Oh, no! Where is it? It's not. This is the second daughter here
between 2,001 and 2,013. I'll go back to the order 1 s, but, like the New York Police Department and the Central Intelligence CIA. They they had a program to target Muslims. I I didn't know that.
Okay. Now I even like you when I once I I read this article. I went to do more research on this and got her more information about it. But imagine imagine and you are Muslim, right? This is the climate, and then you like, and then you have between 2,002 and 2,011. You know you have to go through
extra hoops to get into the United States. If you work for a Muslim country. it's.
and another, and which is funny is that in between 2,002 and 2,011, when people from Muslim countries they had to, you know, to do to go through extra hoops to get their visas to the United States. Ironically.
us
Saudi Arabia. It was easier for Saudi to get, even though a lot of the people who plot that attack allegedly. They were from Saudi Arabia, because, I say allegedly because they died. I mean well, not all of them, but many of them died.
and so they like, you know, technically from the legal perspective, we have evidence. But you know we never had like
a try or anything so for those who died. So we can't say for a 100% sure, but 99%. So
so
very, very ironic because of obviously the United States has very good relationships with Saudi Arabia. But anyways. And then you think about that between 2,017 when Trump was elected in 2,021,
I don't know. If you remember, I remember this very clearly. The first thing the first thing that Trump did on day one in office was to sign an executive order, you know, to to like pretty much make it impossible
for people from most Muslims countries to to to enter, and that is to get a visa to come to the United States. He also put a cap on on refugees from Muslim countries, and that became law, and then one of the things that.
and then that was challenge and everything but remained. And then Biden kind of took that away in the first day in the office, but like so that was. And now so again, Saudi Arabia was excused. I mean Saudi Arabia was not in the pack. People. Are you guys there?
Just in case because I don't see? And then people
okay. Good. Imagine that I mean, you are really your religiosity.
which is very intimate. There's something very that gives meaning to your life that becomes like all the sudden, you become lumped with a bunch of categories that you don't even know the countries that you don't even know
people that you don't even know cultures that you don't even know, you know, and versions of the same religion, because we're usually very accordingly, like Catholicism here in Canada is not the same as Catholicism in Brazil, in in, in, in the version of Islam, you know, Islam is Islam, but the version, like there They are always differences
like, you know, even like if you are. Sunni is not the same as being soon in all the countries I mean, they do share a lot of things, Catholics. They do share a lot of things, but there is like always a little new ones, right? So all of a sudden you are put in a pack, and your pack was labeled was racialized. Okay, now you are Muslim.
and it doesn't matter where you're from what kind of version you practice it doesn't matter anything. What matters is you? You are you become this person. You are classified as Muslim, and and you are the enemy right. So so
on one side there was extremely demoralizing.
extremely oppressing.
extremely fearful, because all of a sudden we start to have, like Muslim people being attacked in the United States all like, you know, since 9 11. But there is a flip side to that. And she discussed this in the article. The flip side is that
that fear
of being attacked, that fear of being accused as anti, American or anti America.
that fear united the community.
So there is a flip side. But obviously nobody deserves to go through that to have their community united right? But anyways.
here people she is arguing in the article.
I'm just See here, let's see. Okay. So we have here in the offense, but kind of makes sense. Why, they kept how to considering Why, they are the large to, You know, politics always. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I tried to say. It's politics right? Like they didn't really care about. I mean, there was all politics, because
the Government needed to give the United the the population an ins, and the easiest answer is to say, let's label someone like a group, and let's call them
like
enemies. And and and we're gonna make the exceptions that we think that's that's gonna help us right like in. We're gonna do it in a hidden way. Obviously the Government did not parade, they say, oh, we're gonna ban Muslims. They're all tourists.
they didn't say. Oh, by the way, I'm just giving you an excuse to Saudi. Okay, no. That part was hidden right like invisible.
So but yeah, you're right. So
So the offer is saying here that visibility plus surveillance.
because that's visibility and surveillance. They go handy hand. Right? So so visibility, post surveillance it, create this atmosphere.
a fear panic panic regime. You know, but not always because people resisted, and they use that in their favor occasionally.
you know, as a form of resistance. We're gonna talk more about that in a second visibility plus surveillance, can lead to the create creation of enemies. And that's what happened in the article in the that's what she found on the ground. Right so, and in the language that was used was risk, danger, pearl, right like
risk
enemies. And then and then that that category was created. But the problem is this bullet point Number 3 here that category called Muslim. It enjoyed it's to enjoys State legitimacy.
because it was the State
that created like. Let me just go back in here for a second.
Look.
this 2,002 2,011 national security, and that system was implemented by Who? By the State, by the Government.
this one here, you know New York Police departments, and sent a CIA targeting Muslim. I mean, this was a State policy
so essentially
the enemy.
It was a creation of the State, so he had legitimacy, and that paved the way that legitimacy, the State saying so that we have an enemy, a domestic enemy. So that means that we
we have to fight this enemy
right so. And then people like groups they start to form.
to target Muslim and to target Muslim people. It became. It became okay. It became almost like tolerable. So people felt that they could go on TV and say whatever they want, because, you know, nobody's. The State is targeting. So I can go in there and say whatever I want. I experience that in Brazil people
Brazil's one of the country that kills Lgbtq. 2 plus the most in the world. It is one of the most danger, Ironically, people think the Brazilians are liberal. Ironically, Brazil is is a country that kills
Lgbtq plus people 2 plus people.
and
and particularly transgender.
So very a big target in Brazil, and in with the last President that we had in Brazil.
Like you know, a a person who was a gay person in Brazil became a target. And all of a sudden, like TV shows and and and TV news, they were like like like they're all they they're always was a an inter person being interview interviewing, interviewed.
and kind of feeling very comfortable to say, oh, I think that homosexual is wrong, and I think that this and I think that. Yes, you know Lgbtq. 2 plus people. They have it, I illness, I mean. All of a sudden I I watch this in my own tree all the sudden it became like people kind of get. They got the ticket
to say whatever they want, because they found State legitimacy because the Government was opposing Lgbtq. 2 plus movement openly right? So so, anyway, that's what happened in the United States. I know that i'm approaching the end here, but i'm going to use my 3 min. So that happened in the United States, and all of a sudden that narrative, it became like
the West versus this
holy war against us. They want to kill us. They want to terrify us. Let's let's let's hunt down. Let's get the imagine I mean. Now again I invite your empathy.
Put yourself in the shoes. Imagine, if you are a Muslim, or if you are a Muslim
for yourself
in that environment, and probably if you are a Muslim. You don't need to picture, because that's that. That's all over to to Canada
that came here, and that is still here.
you know. So that changed the scenario for Muslims I I personally
have witnessed
on the bus at the using. I actually I have witnessed a lot of racism in there, but I have witnessed
people like like saying things like abusing, harassing, and bullying Muslim people on the bus at the Ua.
and I have a weakness that.
and and and I and me and I I was like man Sh! Then to a fiercely interfere, and and and I was like on the verge of interfering, and I was like, okay, should I do it? And I was. My concern was, If this person has a If this person's crazy enough to stand up and say what they say I mean, do they have a knife? That's kind of my, you know, because they could stab me, and you know, or stab other people. So it's like. But I I have been on the verge of fighting back on bus. I think you will be like many times in my in the 10 years that I have lived that I that I am not
so. It's just like so anyways so. And this just to wrap up. So this, like those anti enemy. And I say, I find that in the in this article is Anti-muslim.
But this entire enemy group
it becomes like, okay, are you? Are you with me, or you are with them.
and it creates that binary kind of. and that leads
like that. In that case that's what she found that led, and she's going to give a lot of example because she interviewed 30 people Muslim people
so that led Muslims like
they became desperate like. I need to prove that I'm. I'm not a fat. How do I prove that i'm patriotic? How do I prove that I? This is my country. I love my country. I would never do anything. How do I prove that my religion is not a threat?
So this hypervisibility died of surveillance.
It destroyed people's lives. We're gonna see now examples next time we talk. Okay, so I hope that I mean. So you know you delete, i'm gonna delete this slide and put it back. And then we're gonna catch from here. Then we're gonna see, like some examples, some of the examples that she actually gives. Okay, people
let me just see here, very quick.
Yeah. Scapegoat, Matthew. Exactly that, you know. So
they are I. They are Your question, I mean, your question is, is. you know your question. I it doesn't it. It doesn't even need an answer. I mean it. Is it? That's exactly that You know
we're going to talk about because all the 7 for people who are shooting Matthew. They became crazy.
That was a narrative. All they're mentally you. They're crazy. you know. But for Muslims there was no excuse. They are terrorists.
you know. We're gonna talk more about this. I'm gonna save this.
Oh, i'm going to save your question, Matthew, because I want to say more things up. Actually, I have another.
I have another 5 with like some questions that I saved another day. I'm gonna save your question because we're gonna come back. I don't want to do it right now, because i'm gonna i'm not hurry. Let me see Valencia. Things like happening in India. True.
Exactly. So you see.
I'm going to save yours to
Yeah. This what I'm describing here. Her research is really nice, because he can apply in any context, I mean she talked about Muslims, but you could talk about any other thing right like you could bother any other topic, I mean.
And I see now, Fascia: here. Czech: Republic. Example.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's You're gonna see that that's what people start to do. Okay. So i'm gonna save your questions. I'm: gonna put our comments. I'm gonna put them in there so we can pick. I'm gonna pick it up alone because i'm gonna pre record, but i'm gonna make sure that I I include this in my comments. Okay.
So, people i'm sorry about. I went to 1 min. Thank you very much. You guys take care of yourselves
and and think about. Have some. We think we try to think about what we're we're discussing. Here, put yourself in people's, shoes, and all the sudden you have to do those big narratives. It's crazy.
So take care, and and anyways you're going to hear from me later tonight, because i'm going to put up the marks out there for you.
Thank you, folks.
Thank you very much. You guys take care
if you need me. I'm gonna be in off hours. People. Okay. i'm gonna open it immediately. just saving to stop here.

Mar 2

"Okay, folks, welcome back. This is our surveillance class
to what we're gonna do today. I'm. By the way, i'm talking. I to the next last class. I thought to you from Winnipeg today. I'm talking to you from Plattsburg, upstate New York. I think I told some of you I have to with all of you.
So anyways i'm here I have a a presentation to the lever tomorrow.
so that's why i'm here, and that's why I am for recording this class. Okay. So, folks, we're discussing an article. It. It is our our last art on on Classification and surveillance.
and and I I am kind of halfway through it.
So i'm gonna finish this article today, and that will be it. We're going to start technologies on Tuesday. But before I start technologies on Tuesday. I am gonna we're gonna discuss the assignment because I want you guys to, you know, and also over the weekend. I'm gonna put out put a sample assignment over there. So you guys can have some sample
for you to kind of. You know. We have 2 options right like for assignments. So i'm gonna put a sample. I'll try to put a sample for both of them, if not just for one. But you'll try to do for both.
Okay. So before we start and go back to the article about how Muslims they became hyper visible after 9 11 in the United States. I would like to share something with you.
Actually be. Let me ask you something first in our last class, Matt. Was it met, or grey, or
someone made a very nice, and it's actually 3 people. They need comments in the chat.
and I tried to save them, but I couldn't save, so I I lost those 3 comments. One of them, I remember they had to do a shooting like in the United States. They here in the Us.
I can't remember if it was Matthew or Grier or Valencia. Who was it? So.
please.
when we meet on Tuesday I would like to talk about those 3 comments. Okay, on the chat. It was like the last thing that you guys said in our last class.
So but before I go and pull my slides.
let's see here, I would like to share something with you guys, and I read shared this in class, but I would like you to take a moment and think about it.
Most of us. We don't really have the opportunity to experience. I mean. we have our
our primary identity. You guys remember primary advantages, secondary identity. I'm. Talking about primary.
and that in most cases we don't really change our identity Most cases right? So so not everybody has the opportunity to experience something different.
Why? I'm saying that because I I I said in class several times that
there in Canada I am seeing as Latina or non-white people. I I know that on camera. I look kind of pinkish, but or some people may oh, not really, you know, you know, like when you look me, you see my skin caller. You can. Oh, you know she's not white in Canada
which is crazy right like, but I mean crazy, because in my country I am white. That's why it's crazy. So. But what i'm trying to say here is that it's very unique or very rare, that a person
has the opportunity in life to experience like a situation of privilege in one society. such as in Brazil. in Brazil. I am the norm
in Brazil. I have all the privileges attached to the norm in Brazil. and I can see that because I I I the way that people work
at those who are not white in Brazil.
Right? So I I see that. And then I at being a sociologist, criminologist, I pay attention to those things.
and I I see the way that people treat me
in Brazil, and the way that people treat my colleagues and friends and people that i'm hanging out with that are not white, especially if they are black
and the darker the complexion to scheme, the more abuse people get.
I see it right so, and I in in. But in Canada I have this wonderful opportunity in life that very few people have.
It's almost like you change your scheme. I go from being white in Brazil, and having all this privileges to all the southern Canada. I don't, and i'm not.
And I feel like sometimes people, you know they make stereotypes, you know people are gonna talk to me even like when I was in Minneapolis. People talk to meeting. They they're gonna oh, in Brazil. Soccer.
Come on! I live in Canada. It's been 10 years. I know Canada, you don't. If you want to make small conversation with me, you can make small conversation about Canada, or you know what I mean, like, or sometimes people kind of
you know they kind of. They noticed the accent, and they kind of make a big deal out of it, or it's just like I I feel it right so. But anyway, so it's. But it's wonderful
because I can. I can. It's almost like I can have 2 lives. and not everybody can have that right like so. And I also like to add to this comment. I mean it's just for you to observe to think
it. It. It is very hard people like it. It is sometimes intimidating for me.
I remember when I did the research in Pharmacut Murray, we've Professor Sarah Dahl a very few things in life in team date. Me, i'm very confident. but like when I had to do interviews in pharmacist Murray, which is a very, very white environment and very mailing environment.
me as a woman. So I had intersections as a woman, and also as a known white person. I would feel a little bit intimidated when I had to walk into a group of guys, you know, drinking their team heart and team heartens coffee.
and I had to kind of create conversation. So you know, because almost like what you're doing here. Don't belong to you, and I could feel it right like not those guys. They were very nice to me, but, like I I felt awkward. I felt like.
you know, and and indeed, and I would talk to them. They would be like what like they
like most of them they were knives like, but like they there. But there was this strangeness like kind of you know, you strange stranger right like.
But anyways, I talked about Brazil privilege. I talked about Canada not so much privilege.
and I lived in China. and in China
like China, is very uniform. From the like racial cultural perspective, I mean 95% of the people. They are the same ethnic group in terms of like they share the same kind of habits that's booked their way.
and they look at me. They don't they don't really make a big difference between the whites like it's almost like
in Canada or in the United States, Like people make more, you know, like
they classify differently, and they make differences like in Canada, in China. If you're not Asian, you're you, and if you're not Asian, if you're not, if you're not black, you're white, so like you look at me anything that i'm white, but they don't realize that
they are different scales of white. You know what I mean, like anyways, but in in China I enjoy privilege because they see it like oh, you are a foreigner.
you know all you are, for like it. It's different than Canada and Canada is like oh, you talk English with an accent. It's it's not good.
or it's confusing
unclear, but like in in China is like.
if you speak a little bit of Chinese or a lot of Chinese. They they are in all they go like you speak Chinese, you know. I never had anybody in Canada saying, oh, you speaking.
you speak like English or French. No like
It's like it's almost like you want to come here, you must.
But in China no, they kind of wow, you know you are amazing that that's how they kind of you know.
So it's like. So there I am with I am. I am a deviant. I'm not the norm. But I am. I enjoy that that that position of privilege again. Right? So it's like, Anyways, I had all this.
So i'm saying this, because sometimes I Why am I having this conversation with you?
Because sometimes I have students who say mar cell. I am white
and there like just like the example that you give last class, we can flip it. I am white, and when I go into group all let's say I, if you take me to your Brazil and barbecue, where everybody's going to be Brazilian.
I will feel kind of weird because i'm not like I'm gonna be the I will be like you, you being the why, you will be the deviant
right? So? And then I say, yeah, True, this is correct. However. there is one advantage
like even when a white person. he is a minority in a group.
Okay. that white person has like it's almost like it has the
I'm talking about social structures. It's structures in society, right? Because not everybody think the same way. But, like structurally speaking, that person.
you know, like that person, has what is admirable, or what is that? Whatever I don't want to say everybody wants to have, because that's not the case, but it's like. But what like? From the political perspective from the economic perspective. That is, that is the the top that is like, you know. That is something that
that everybody validates, you know, as being, you know
as being positive. That's what i'm trying to say. So. If you are. you know a white person. and in whatever society
and or you know, and you walk into a group of non-white people you you still may feel. Oh, I don't belong in here or it's. Weird. Or you know that I i'm deviant right like that that little feeling that you are deviating from the norm.
However. you still have that you still can get like some sort of it's almost like the that reassurance that you are at the top of that.
you know.
like
society, I mean, even though you don't belong in that society. that that reassurance. It kind of supports you. It supports you being in that society.
you know.
So I don't know if i'm making sense, and I wish that we were, we would be together to talk this. But I I really I I've been thinking about this since I left our last class.
and
and you know i'd like you to think because I mean not. Everybody has this opportunity to, you know. I'm saying this because I I have experience both.
So you know, in China again, many, many times in China, in in the 7 years that I lived in there people would point me in the street like people would ask to take a picture of me, especially like in the early 2,000, because, you know, they for them I was like
a complete kind of. They would never see a
a person like me. So they would ask me. You know, P. Kids, they would point me. They would ask to touch my hair, they would ask to, you know. Now, China change it so. They're more used to foreigners, but like, but you know.
but and that was extremely uncomfortable many occasions, and also. and it didn't feel good in many occasions, because it's almost like you are the deviant. However, I knew that
you know
at the bottom line is.
i'm not a subject of stigma. It's the opposite. They they envy that, or they or not envy. The it is on the right word, but like the but that's positive.
So it's very different when you are like
a an object of attention.
and you enjoy hyper, vigilance, hyper, surveillance, and hypervisibility.
and you are not as associated with something positive. I don't know if i'm making sense. I hope i'd like you guys to watch this and and go back to this next class and let me know.
you know. So you know it's different, I mean. So if a a white person goes and let's say, you know
South Sudan, you know
again, that person's gonna be like it's gonna flash. It's gonna be like completely outside, right? It's gonna be. An outs there's gonna be like
like a hyper surveillance on that person hyper visibility on that person. But that person will have that reassurance that that you know, that
that whiteness is associated with, and it doesn't have to be a Canadian white. It can be a Marcella white that whiteness is associated with something that's positive
not all globally like it, you know I because again think about South Sudan immigrants. They don't come to not. I mean not. You know now that we don't have that. It's just to them. But like, but, like you know, like
they go to to Canada, they go to so like, you know. So like even the global political economy. So it's so. When you are a minority, I mean you, you know, but like, but
associated with something positive. it's great. And that's what quite often happens to whites in situations of minority.
But when you are not, which is the case of the Muslims that we are studying is extremely hard, right? So, anyways, Otherwise, this is making sense. I hope it is, but it's all to make you think
about hyper hyper visibility, surveillance. You know how people feel. Okay. So let me just share my slides with you, so we can continue the conversation.
So people and I'm: i'm glad I don't know if this is gonna work. But i'm glad that I am bringing this up to you, and that I actually, if you say, put it out. So you think about it, right? So Oh.
okay, yeah, that's cool.
So that's we saw we were talking about this. So, like, you know, we talked about norms, because again. We we we, whenever people whatever you want to, lies. If it is not biology, not math, not physics. You have to always think social norms. What are the what is the norm right like?
And so we we covered this already slide. So this is in last last in here. We also cover. That's where I stopped. I actually stopped here at this latest, the last bullet point, saying that
you know that that portray, or that, like the
When the United States. The Government started to kind of create programs to do surveillance on Muslims after 9 11
that gave State legitimacy. you know, that made them need that surveillance of Muslims legit. and as a consequence.
a lot of groups in in the American society. They start talking about Muslims as
as a danger, as a threat as East versus West as they are trying to attack us. They are trying to kill us, kick them out right so because I mean then people and I think I mentioned this in class, that that that's quite often. Whenever the Government reproduce those
narratives that the exclude people
people on the ground they feel more like comfortable to exclude others. Right so. And then the the
and then, like the the author says, based on the 30 interviews that she did that Muslims. They they they kind of. They. They begun to strive to look patriotic, patriotic, a
patriotic
right like. So they want to be okay. And then they themselves, the Muslims themselves in the United States. They start to do self surveillance because, you know, they say okay, I I need to behave in a way that I that I don't look to Muslim.
I need to say things or not, say things in a way that it's almost like. Try to control that visibility right?
And in that self surveillance led
to neutral surveillance. I am brief surveillance. Okay, I As a Muslim, I should not say those things about politics whatever. I should have white politics, for example. And then I would also do surveillance on my community. If you don't, don't talk about politics because talking about politics. Can you know it's going to flag us? It's going to make us even more
more visible. So in, and that mutual surveillance within the Muslim community led to a lot of mistrust and even fights within the community
on the flip side.
That's that. That whole situation like you know Muslim people being super hyper, enjoying hyper-visibility and being super surveilled.
that
created more unity. Or I, like kind of you know, and also helped Muslims Muslim Americans to define who they are
right, so
I would like to I if you see all my slides there blue, blue, blue, and then there is a black one here. I did this so just to highlight that there is something very nice that the offer says it says, Look.
In her opinion, her analysis. Invisibility is not privacy, because sometimes we may think I I know that we have discussed privacy.
but sometimes people might believe that being visible is
having privacy. In fact, I remember that when we discussed privacy i'll some people on the chat.
they said. Oh, you know, like privacy to being visible. I remember that was I can't remember who wasn't doesn't matter. Well, one person said that.
and that was interesting like right, but like this I I I can understand that what the person said.
But this author here she disagrees with that. She says, Look, Invisibility is not privacy. invisibility. He is the manipulation of visibility.
So it's almost like you
you manage when you want to be off, and you're gonna be on, or you do things to try to kind of make you more visible and visible, usually more invisible. So I found this sentence really interesting. I might throw a question about this on the exam next final exam.
So keep this in mind. Okay.
So she she did. I mean, I really like this article because she actually interviewed people right like she. She interviewed people so she talked to 30 people
in Los Angeles and in Los Angeles, United States you have the largest.
you know Muslims they are. They are in especially Muslims, from like South Asia.
They are the largest, you know, a group of of Muslims in the United States born outside of the United States. So that is really interesting. I didn't know that actually.
And so she interviewed 30 people.
Muslim Americans so good in Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and also Indians. Okay? And she also did some ethnographic observations like hanging out with this group.
this this group of people, and she also did documentary information. She, you know, went to see reports and stuff from the government. So here people.
she's gonna say she. Now she's going to actually like this this section of the article where she goes like leading everyday lives as hypervisable Muslims in a security atmosphere
here. It gets really nice, even nicer, in my opinion, because that's when she starts to share
what people told her in. Feel the work right like. So she she starts off telling you about a guy. but he and his friends they were, you know, he, this guy, and some people they were traveling.
and then they stopped at the gas station to to check some maps.
and and then, like someone saw them. Imagine, Imagine, put yourself in the shoes of this folks, You you know
we're traveling you for friends, you you you, you know, stop it to get gas station. and then you pull out a map, and then you're checking the map.
you know, to see if you are in the right road, or because you're afraid to get lost.
and then people see that, and for whatever crazy reason that I can't even imagine. they believe that you are a terrorist because you are checking a map.
I don't know where people get those ideas really honestly. But the the this is a real example, so like that per like this for this research participant was reported.
and very quickly approach it by the FBI.
So someone reported like immediately because there was this program
to survey all Muslims happening. It was very easy. FBI, someone patrolling someone on the streets were okay. There is this potential terrorist. And then, you know.
they were approached by an FBI.
So you imagine, right like I would. This is crazy.
So so several participants they report to the the
they feared looking to Muslim, and and they often avoid discussing over the phone
because they were afraid of being tapped. Are you like
a lot of people because of fear? They change the way
that they dressed? So there is a story of a woman. She goes to the supermarket, I mean. This is all the article she goes in the supermarket.
and instead of using the black hijab. She She wears a pink one because she realizes that when she has the black one people really look at her, and they kind of with this approval, kind of looks.
and the pink one is kind of the loop, but this kind of it breaks that you know that that it changes the way that people look and and surprises people even right, because we
And there's other story
where this family you're walking somewhere, and then the the mother and she has a She has a an outfit that is identified with like Islam, and must be Muslim, and she, you know she she's gonna throw something in the garbage, and she misses the garbage, and then that stuff doesn't on the floor, and she does not pick it up.
and then her husband gets mad at her and says, Look you're you're you're a Muslim, you're addressing
You're dressed like a Muslim people are watching you, so you can't just not pick it up. You have to pick it up, and then that becomes a family fight. But the point is. you know, if
and I've seen those in Canada. Okay.
if you are. Can they like? The point is, if you are on American like. you know not Muslim, just white, a white American, not black.
And then you later. It's just because you later, or just because you are a pig, right, whatever like. But that's it right. So that that's how people talk about it.
And but if you are black, if you are Hispanic, if you are a Muslim, your leader.
you throw something on the ground. Oh, that's because you're a Muslim. Oh, that's because you're black. Oh, that's because you're a hispanic right? So like
I've seen this a lot in Canada. I've even and I've seen even like immigrants talking about immigrants like this.
I have heard my fellow Brazilian saying, oh, you know
it like you know, this person like the the drive like this, you know, because they are like Brazil and Blah blah, blah, and like as if every single Canadian.
you know, born in person, born in Canada or white Canadian
as you Everybody
a drove wonderfully on the streets, which we all know. That's not the case. In fact, if you know, if you you know, do a little Google search. You're gonna see that a lot of like most accidents, and that you don't do have nothing to do with the immigrants.
right? But like.
but anyways. But if you're I need to get yourself in a car crash I mean, that's because you are brown. That's because you're black.
So it's very complex right so. And that happened with the Muslims in there, so that hyper that hyper visibility very quickly becomes about negative things right like
so Another thing that she said is that because of the
the level of violence against Muslims
in the United States
people they start to have a very clear separation between public life and private life.
so should say that some people they would. They would not practice, or you know that they would avoid talking about slum slamming public. they would avoid politics in general, which is a problem. Imagine you live in a country, and then you you should not talk about politics, or you should not. My political life is something extremely important for all of us right? But, like all of a sudden, you know, you have state policies that they
this create such a dynamic that I mean that people don't want to talk about politics anymore.
So
so like
Muslims to kind of look less Muslims or not true Muslim, they would show concern forwards. Other other topics, such as great greats, rent, and all that kind of stuff.
No.
they would avoid any kind of situations that would expose their Muslimness, you know, portray themselves as moderate.
and and she makes a very good job at problematizing what is moderate. Oh, I am Muslim, but I moderate. Oh, i'm Catholic, but a moderate! What is this
so sanctions like? I'm not a a terrorist right like
so. And
and in how do you portray yourself as a moderate, just by remaining silent? So it's it's.
I don't know I really enjoy this article because she I mean she does empirical work.
and I I I like I like empirical work. and she also has theory, and I like theory. So she finds a good balance. Right? So I hope you're going to read this. I definitely. I'm going to put a lot of questions from this article in the exam. So please read in the final exam.
and then she says that you know a lot of organizations in the United States. They are working very hard to review the Muslim identity, you know, to kind of
You know that in like what is it right like to be Muslim, and also to be American? So you have to reconcile those 2 things, and a lot of organizations are doing trying to do that right like that reconciliation.
So, people, that's it. Let me just see if I if I have anything else from this
pretty cool.
and I don't think I have. So that's that's it. So we're gonna stop here. This is gonna be a super short class like half an hour.
and we're gonna come back. We're gonna come back like live on Tuesday. and and I hope that you know, we're going to be all there, and and we're gonna talk about technology. Okay?
And then I have. I have a little bit of ketchup to do. But please read the article. Read the article. Another thing that I want to tell you is.
think about what I said about like, you know you being okay. I am a white person, and I am, you know, Brazilian barbecue, and I feel weird because that's on my culture, or that's because you know that, like too many people of color that I've never seen before.
But but that gives you kind of that assurance. Okay. But
you know i'm white kind of.
and obviously
all those things they don't. They don't sometimes those processes. They happen very quickly in our mind, and
and sometimes it's not conscious right. We just know, i'm confident because I am I you know, kind of I I have nothing, nothing to fear. There is nothing wrong with me almost like that, right like I can walk into that barbecue because there is nothing wrong with me.
anyways, and put all of that into debate or comp or discussion about social norms, okay society and social arms that we like. If you don't know what i'm talking about. Watch less less classes. Video: okay.
So people, that's it. You guys take care of yourself.
Yeah, take care of yourselves. Okay.
anything. You shoot me an email
by folks.

"Hello, folks! Do you guys hear me? Do you see me?
Hello, everybody! Welcome to our class surveillance studies. Okay, Great to see some of you here Very nice
people. I would like to start by talking a little bit about our assignment. First of all, did you guys started already or not yet, or where are you at? I mean, what kind of topic are you choosing?
Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Some people. Yes. Okay. So look
I. Okay, that's good. Okay, so people, the most important thing about this assignment is you have to make something that's like, okay, let's let's just talk about the first option first. Okay, so let me just get the chat here on the side.
So look, I believe you'll see my screen right like. So the first option. You got to choose one of those 2 options, so I we gave you
like like I gave you one of 2 options. So the first one is like you discussing how the pandemic altered surveillance in Western societies
because of of of the pandemic, I mean, you know now we we we have much more surveillance than before.
But what I recommend to you is like You pick something like, you know. Surveillance in some sort of setting can be in in health care can be in the household. It can be in the workplace. So pick something, you know. Be specific. Okay. So I mean.
talk about like in general terms. But then, when you're going to actually discuss the topic, go specific. Okay. So choose some sort of setting where you know you're going to discuss that change. And then the most important thing here is because it is a very short essay. So is you to keep
to keep it like. If you come with that language full of fillers. You You're not going to have space.
so you need to be. You need to be mindful that this is like a. Your English needs to be crisp, and it should be like, you know. You gotta think about each sentence that you're writing, because if you put stuff in there just for the sake of writing.
It's not gonna work. So if you do a last minute assignment, which is doable.
But probably you're not. It. It's gonna be shallow because you're not gonna have time to edit. So I recommend you guys to start like as soon as possible like this week. So you're gonna have like several weeks just to kind of, you know, Polish and try to kind of, you know.
Remove any kind of fillers and make space for things for ideas. Actually. Okay. So let me just see here what people are saying.
Yeah. So just like. But you know, as you guys are thinking, just start typing. I mean.
I have this mantra. I When I think people I don't think in my head, I think in some paper. So right now, okay, right now, whatever you're thinking.
even if it's just like thinking, just put it on paper. Okay, so so it's very, very short. So I don't want you guys to go above 2,100 like 21100 words stay below that, or on that. Okay. I also don't go too short, because otherwise you won't have space.
and and you're going to have to do a little bit of research on on your own right. So and i'm asking you to articulate at least 2 ideas.
You know that we discussed in the course. So you know you're gonna reference at least 2 materials that, but like it's not just like. Sometimes I see people just referencing for the sake of referencing that will not cut. I want, like you to engage with whatever I mean, you know. Just don't. Oh, i'm gonna throw this stuff in there so I can check a box, and then I get that, you know, extra point, for you know, referencing. I mean No. Make sure that you're actually engaging with something
that we discussed in this course. Okay.
let me see what else like in case you want to reference. I don't really like okay people referencing letter my lectures because my lectures, they're often based on something. So instead of like referencing me. Just go and reference the actual thing
this is in here. Because again, I am teaching the scores on behalf of Dr. Kevin Hagerty, and that's how he likes. Okay, so he doesn't mind, but I which I understand because he's a huge name in surveillance. So you know he doesn't mind being cited.
But I I don't. You know it's for me. I think that you know the ideal thing is you to site the actual source always, you know, not like people's lecture unless that lecture is kind of published, you know, official matter. But whatever because I am like, I i'm using his model. And this is his course. I mean.
you know, if you decide that you're gonna cite me, just make sure that you're gonna cite like where I said and how I said, and so, if need be, you can always go back and retrieve that lecture. So we just be sure to be clear. Okay, let me see questions. If you have questions or comments.
So far, so far, so good people, is this clear questions about this first version of the assignment
Questions about it. Folks
make sense. Okay, clear. Okay, Good. So you ask again.
there is No.
It's like, Make sure you're doing honest work, and you're gonna get good grade. So like, you know, like honest, clean. Okay. So straight to the point.
Okay. And then the second one, the second one is, I wouldn't say it's harder, but it requires probably a little bit more of thinking, because this isn't like, you know, this is actually again. This is this assignment was designed by Kevin Hagerty.
and if you read his article on the Surveillance assemblage assemblage which we discussed in class. He he rocks up. I don't know if you guys remember this
he wraps up by saying that now, with this the lab of surveillance and the types of surveillance that we have now, it is nearly impossible to disappear
right? So he's saying that you know that that disappearance is is disappearing at the our ability to disappear is disappearing. So that's how he wrapped up. I also covered that in the lecture. So
i'd like, I mean that this is his ex. And actually I find particularly I like his assignment a lot. I think that this is like a good, you know, like a good exercise. How could we disappear? So you're gonna describe and and you're gonna make it feasible. Okay, so of course, you might need some money to disappear.
But again, you can't just throw like, you know, 20 million dollars in there, or even a 1 million dollars in there because who has that money right? So you gotta be feasible, like something that would be, You know, that an average person would be able to do
so. This is the secret of this assignment here. If you start to kind of go like, oh, you're not going to need like X millions to do this and this I mean.
that's not gonna fly, because I mean that doesn't really apply, you know.
to the you know, to the average person in Canada. So think about the average person in Canada. Okay, really, literally like average, not someone in poverty, not someone to reach. You would be like the average Canadian. Okay, so. And then you're gonna describe that plan, and you're gonna go like as detailed as possible. And and and and that's that's pretty much what you're gonna do. Okay.
And and Don't forget here that you know, like about about 400 words like a little bit of a discussion.
you know, like you should be about like. You know the lessons that you learned, you know, like like doing this this exercise. Okay, so it's not so much, because probably you're not gonna be able, I don't know. But like judging from a previous years from the assignments that I've seen, I mean, you're not gonna be able to
really find. I mean, you're gonna it's pretty hard to disappear. Maybe you're you're you're clever enough that you're gonna find a solution. But but the most important here is the reflection. Like it's like, okay, you know.
like once you realize, you know what would be your plan. I mean, how do you reflect back on that? Questions, comments. concerns about this?
I know again, Don't don't do it last minute, because this is gonna like, need some polishing, and if you do it last minute, that's a problem. You're not gonna have time to polish, and it's gonna be packed with fillers like, you know, very little ideas and a lot of feelers. And then that's gonna compromise your mark.
Let me just see here, Kathleen.
Okay, citation style. No, I mean I citation style honestly any citation that you want to use. I know pretty much all of them like Apa Chicago, but like, just make sure that you are consistent. So don't switch between them. I mean, just pick any of any of each, whatever you want to use.
But, like, you know, be consistent. Okay? And and again Why, i'm not like Picky about it, because usually I mean, you know, this is not a big deal, and and especially I mean, like you. You know the when you publish
like academic work. Each journal has their own style, so they ask. They tell you this style, and then you switch according accordingly. So I recommend you in case I don't know if you're familiar.
Sure, I mean, this is a very short break paper. You're not going to be signing a lot. but like sometimes, when you're doing your fees, you're capstone, your owners, Whatever I recommend, You guys to check this thing here, Zoe.
I recommend you to check. This is citation software. And what is nice about the software is that let's suppose you know you're gonna do an assignment. And the pro, you know. As for Apa, and then, like the profits crazy, and then that person changed. Oh, no, I want Chicago all you have to do.
You know this? So there it plugs to your word, document and all you have to do in case the proph changed their mind. Because there's there's crazy people everywhere. You just going there and switch the plug you. You You change the button. You tell you. Tell the software format I I, according to format this paper, according to Chicago. Do it according to Apa. Do it according to the Brazilian, you know, Standard. I mean it's easy.
so it's not a big deal. Okay, so I mean, I can for this papers too small. So you don't really need it. But sometimes you're doing projects that you require lots of lots of citations, so I recommend you to use a a software. And what is nice about the software is that the software, when you go to the U. Of a website, library website.
and you find a book, or you find an article that you're going to be citing in your paper. You can plug. You can suck that information into the software and
and put it back in your paper. So you know. So it's like you don't really have to do anything manual. I don't know if you guys use that kind of stuff. I don't know how much you people write, you know.
No, no disappear. Lucy, disappear here is like disappear like you know, evade surveillance. Okay, that's what I mean by disappear
and let's see what else? More questions people concerns, questions just put up there, so I can answer them.
Okay. So I am still so trying to find a a good sample for you, I did not find. I went to see
what Hagerty had a last term when he thought this course, but he said, No, Marcella, i'd rather that you don't give them a sample, because this is again. This is his course so, but i'm still trying to find something that I mean that it doesn't come from, you know, like his class. So so I Haven't found yet, but i'm still. So I hope to find something that can get You help. You guys get inspiration. Okay, so i'll let you know as soon as I find, and and put it on the class for you.
So let's see what else any other questions concerns? No? Can we? Can we go to my my, to this class. Let's see.
Yes, you can, you? You can may see you can please be my guest. Yes, I mean again, the more you bring it home the better, because it's easier. I mean it's kind of it, and it makes a very
in like very grounded right like it. It's not like some delusional paper. No, it's like grounded. It's actually it works out. I mean, it actually works as a plan. Okay.
So
okay, so i'm gonna stop sharing this thing here, and I am going to share my other thing with you, so we can get we can start.
So, folks. Okay.
i'm actually very excited about this specific topic. Let me just get this.
Oh, one more thing.
I released the exam. Marks to you folks. I am just waiting. I have one more person taking the exam this Thursday
and Thursday night. I am going to release the questions for you. So you guys can go in there, read the questions, and then you, if you have questions or concerns, or whatever you can, always come to me, email me or come to off hours. So you're going to be able to see them, and I know that some people here they want to talk to me, or you are very welcome, you know, so as you, so I will release the questions, and then you can see them, and then we can talk about them. And now we will also tell you which questions I deleted, or I gave you guys the points right? Because, like
like I, I had 3 questions on the exam that less than 30 of the class got them right, so I chop them, and I gave the entire class extra points for those questions
so. But anyways you i'm going to read when I release the exam to you, i'm gonna shoot you an email saying I released the exact questions going there, check them up. And now, so i'm gonna tell you which questions I deleted. So you don't you don't, I mean, you won't you, anyways, so that is not a it gets that outside of out of your way. Okay.
Can I make? I dent a a new identity, or do I have to completely be gone and and and i'll know. Yeah, you have to be gone. You have to be gone. That's the challenge. They, Jacob. Jacob. Good question. No, that's the thing, because I mean it's possible to do a new identity. And look, when you guys think about this.
what what the hard part is to disappear when you think about this, I mean, this is just quick invitation for you. Think about.
Think about people
like how difficult it is for those programs to protect witness. Do you know, when you have like when you are FBI or CIA, or you know the royal, the Monties, I mean the the Rcmp. And you need to make people disappear to protect them.
you know.
and pretty much evade surveillance, and and that is still not even fully disappear. It's kind of kind of in between disappearing and and giving them a new identity. But even though it's really hard, it's really really hard to protect people.
you know. So as you do think about. If you're going to do that. That assignment number true. Think about that, you know.
If you were like a police person you had to protect someone, you know.
Make someone just up here. Okay. So i'm gonna start here. And then, if you have questions, you'll stop me.
Okay, so completely gone. Do we need to to do to do. We need to somehow completely get rid of our additional food. We know. No, that is like
that would be like a like totally impossible. But what you need to do is you? You can't. I mean you. You have to be gone, I mean, maybe you're going to have a footprint, but that foot can all lead to you like right like, because right now as we are, it's very easy to find me where I am, I mean. Probably you know I mean you can, you know, if you can hack my IP address You're going to see that now. I'm talking to you from Edmonton. You're going to see my zip code and every my postal quote and everything. So No, no, you have to be in a way that doesn't. Get to you right that you were
actually
like in visible, or you are.
Yeah. no. So you don't have to disappear if you're good. But you you have to be an obtain a bore, and that you or or you have to behind
exactly something like that. You you could play with that. Yeah, Matthew, You could.
you know you could play with that as if again the for the motive, the reason why you need to disappear it doesn't really matter, just like in the assignment. It says, let's let's suppose you have to disappear for whatever reason someone's chasing you, or you are a criminal, or you know, or you're in hide because of whatever it doesn't really matter. The reason what matters is that you need to disappear. Okay.
Nobody can be able to find you.
So okay, people, i'm gonna go in here. And then if I have more questions, just throw in there.
So this this chapter in our course is called oh, i'm! Just double check. This double double. Okay. This chapter in our course is called Technologies New and old.
but it's actually you're going to see if you read any of the stuff any of the stuff that we're discussing today? It's actually about the workplace.
And so here's the plan for you. I am going to talk to you about. First, i'm gonna give you some contacts. Then i'm gonna cover the first article and then the second one, and then i'm gonna give you. I'm going to share with you some of the research that I did with Professor Sarah Doro.
who is a prophet, the Department of Sociology at the U. Of a I did with her in for Mcmurray. Okay, about surveillance and how surveillance works in pharmacy. So let's let's get started. So
first some context people context. Look.
I don't know where you guys are coming from. I don't know what, Major Minor. You know what special to you are in.
But here's something for you. Very basic. I don't know if you ever thought about it. We live in the capitalist society. That means that our mode of production, our the like. The reason why we produce is for money.
So we produce the things that we produce as a society.
because we need to make money, because we need to accumulate money. So that's that's called the Capitalist Society. If you need more information, what that means you can feel free to ask, and and you know, and throw your questions in there. And here is something. So here's a very important You like, you know.
information for you serve Valence on this massive scale.
It was born with capitalism.
So look, pay attention here. Surveillance has always been there. I mean, we have always had people watching people. We have always had some sort of government watching their their their people or their citizens, I mean. Well, the the idea of sits is a new idea. It's like just 500 years, but, like you know, but like we always had someone in a position of authority watching someone who is, you know, like not in a position of all authority. So that has always been there, however.
massive, systemic surveillance that was born with capitalism. Okay, so keep this in mind, and surveillance was born as a career.
When we do some history of our economy of our kind economic system. we see what I have for you in here like i'm just get get this thing out of the way.
Okay. So we happen here. We had like
capitalism. If we go steady the system. Since the industrial revolution in England like 2, 300 years ago. We're gonna see that, You know. We had the working men which the working people right? So it's the people
i'm using here to like I'm. I'm. I'm drawing this lecture a lot on how marks marks people when when I say call marks, people think about Communism and Socialism. But actually he was one of the person who explained how capitalism work
works the best. So he was one of the best kind of analysts of capitalism. So, and i'm using his scholarship here in this lecture. So that's why it says like work, man, not work working people or so, because it's old scholarship. Right? So it's like. So, anyways, we have the person who would work.
And then a promotion in the beginning of capitalism, immense to become a overseer. Okay, so someone who would watch. and even to this date I don't if you agree with me. But to be promoted, it means that you're gonna take more responsibility. But it also means that you're gonna be watching other people's work, right? So so usually when we look at the history of of capitalism and in this mode of production.
So we go from workman or working people, and then to oversee overseers. And this is like all the English kind of people. We don't talk that way anymore, and then we go to superintendent, which would be a kind of a super surveyor agent, and then we will become a partner
which is a master, you know. So that that was, you know, the beginning of capitalism.
And and and look at this. This is like Marx explaining how capital is analyzing capitalism, you know, back in the nineteenth century, and saying that the work man should should, should, should should have straw. It's driven for R to recommend themselves by attention and industry, so they could kind of rejoice in the prosperity of their master. So it's like it's almost like the idea is that you know you have to learn how to watch.
and then so you can eventually become a master. Okay? So that was like this is like him explaining, looking at the factories during the Industrial Revolution, and and explaining how capital has worked. Is this to alien to you or you guys are kind of I mean, you know, when I say capital is when I say industrial revolution. You guys know what i'm talking about.
Let me know here on the check, please, is it? This is all those ideas I mean I already obvious to you, or I mean kind of you know you think about this, or it's something that you never thought about it. I'm sure. In high school you did a little bit of studying on the Industrial Revolution and beginning the factories and all that kind of stuff. Or am I wrong to assume that?
Okay. So, Matthew, Probably you are in sociology, or business, or or economy, or or Paul Science, probably. Okay. So it's familiar. I'll keep going. And you guys ask questions. Right? So look another thing here.
Yeah, okay, Good. Okay, this is perfect. So let's go. So this is more of Marks telling you. Okay, and he goes like you know that the whole thing here people
it's like, you know
you wanna make workers like in Cap. According to Marx, his interpretation and his observer observations at the beginning of capitalism. The Industrial Revolution, like you, want to make workers to like to cooperate
right. So you want to make you want to make you want to make them to, you know. Like to cooperate among this themselves and also with you. If you are the master, so you can do what so you can extract surplus value. Surplus value means profit.
Okay, so that's the old English for profit. So you can get that extra value. That profit right? So, and exploit labor power so you can put people to work for you, so you can get that, you know, and you want to watch them so you can get the best of them, and also the most amount that they can produce for you. Okay, so I think
this is kind of obvious in general. We just don't think about that right? So so when we think about like when we think about. So i'm telling you look
surveillance, and this a massive scale that we see today was born with capitalism. It pairs very well with the capitalist system, and so it is about creating or enhancing cooperation.
It is about enhancing productivity in the workplace, and it is about profitability, right? That that's why you need corporation, so you can get productivity so you can get profitability. That's how the system works. So.
And in the eighteenth century surveillance used to be like dispersed and watching you, and literally, literally with some sort of
something like a
how you say in English button like a you know, some some instrument that he could actually hate to you if you did not work, you get beaten up.
So that was the practice. And then, if, like labor laws and everything they evolved, and we moved away from that. So now we don't bit up anybody we just, you know we give them rewards like work hard, so we can get a reward right. But the but at the beginning of the of capitalism we didn't have this idea. Employers, and you don't think no. Instead of beating up them, i'm going to give them a reward. They didn't think that way they thought actually was actually workplace was very violent, right? So so, anyway. So today.
So today, what we have is like more a system
like in you know it doesn't have to be in a factory, you know. But we we have. Actually, I should actually, instead of putting this factory here, I could put a camera like what we have. Now is this like work is organized in a way that data from is being is, you know it's being collected from employee all the time. Right? So it's like you, you as employer you are, you know you. You have technologies at your disposal. You can organize work in a way that you know that you you do surveillance on them.
And so I put this factory here because the factory was the first place where we saw, like. We moved away from this kind of violent situation where people beat you up. If you don't work to a situation where it's more like about work, work, organization and surveillance and technology. And it's obviously at that. At the beginning of capitalism technology was very like very
rustic. It was very low tech right. We didn't have cameras. We didn't have microcomputer. We didn't have to stop that we have today. Right so. But this is just a kind of context for you. So look
so
like, however, like when we look at this like history of capitalism in a kind of all the way from, you know, like the Industrial Revolution to today.
especially in the beginnings, like you know, or like eighteenth century, and then, like early nineteenth century, and then, like you know, even like beginning of twentieth century surveillance was very expensive, because we didn't have technology and surveillance
like meant having many people watching many people. So that is expensive, right? Because you it's almost like. I hire you to do something for me. I hire so and so to do something for me, and then I have to hire another 2 people to watch you do that thing right? So essentially it's like I had to hire this guy here. So that was very expensive. So when we look back at the at the history of capitalism. There is a very I mean, you know, this this guy here, John Andyat. He was an Irish guy who actually moved to the United States, and he was one of the first person to say, Look, we need to make surveillance. More
are rationalized. We need to make surveillance more economical, so we can't have this guy here because we we can't afford paying so many of them. So we have to create some sort of work organization. So we can, You know we can.
We can watch people working to factories. And then John, like he. He did a lot of work with slavery in the United States because he came to the Us later, like in life, like when he was about like 30. So he came to the United States, and he was actually like using, like slavery as a case
as a case study for for employers to move away from slavery, you know, and like in in and and and slavery. He was like, look, slavery doesn't work because of many reasons. And for him he was more on the money side. He was like, okay, it doesn't work, like, you know, some people were advocating for human rights and everything, but for him was about money, for he was, If you slave someone.
Obviously that person is going to be working against their will. Obviously the name in itself says it's a slave. So that means that you're going to have to put You're going to have to heighten surveillance, so that person works right. So so he was like, No, no, so slavery is not a good idea, because it's going to cost too much money to watch them. So let's, you know. Make everybody an employee. Let's like, Abolish slavery and and and and then we move away
from that, and then we try to create a workplace where people will kind of like. You know, we won't need to watch people on a one on one kind of basis, or at least we won't have to pay people to watch people so so many people to watch so many people so, and also he was like complaining.
or like his amounts, that you know, the idea of slavery requires a kind of surveillance that erodes, that destroys trust, which is obvious, right? I mean, if we enslave me, i'm not gonna trust you. I'm gonna hate you. And you're gonna definitely
right. So he was like. No, so we can't have that system doesn't work. So let's abolish it. So people had different to it. Opinions on why slavery had a had to be abolished, and that was his opinion. And he really kind of had a movement in the United States kind of, you know, like to create a wave a movement in the Us. Against slavery, but not for because of our human rights, but because of the money signed right. So
so for him, like there was like a
2 ways to optimize surveillance, so like. So to make it like more, you know, like like, you know. So for him was like, we need to make surveillance. We have to pay people so for us to be able to remove the surveillance
that surveillance where it's a person watching you for us to be able to remove that we're gonna we? We should start paying people by piece work.
So instead of paying
for like hours, how many hours they worked. We're going to pay them by piece. So, like, you know, like if if this is a a a factory that we produce pens, we're okay. How many pieces did you produce? Okay, 3, it doesn't matter if it took me like an hour, or you know, a day to make those 3 P. I'm going to get paid by 3, so that automatically it makes people to produce more because they want to get. You know the mix. It enhance the productivity.
You guys realize that I mean, is it obvious to you? I mean, if you pay by piece, you know you make it more. You force people to become more productive, and then you can take. You may take away some of the surveillance, because again, I don't need
to watch them, because it isn't their big best interest to produce as many pens as they can produce people. So far. Is it good
people? Are you guys there?
It makes sense. Okay, I don't know I I I really like this this topic, because that's when we we see the beginning of surveillance. I don't know we talked a lot about surveillance so far. But we I didn't point for you. You know how surveillance like. You know how the surveillance that we had in society. How it came to be right. So in here. It's like, you know.
in in, and if you look like, if you ask your parents or your grandparents for those of you who are lucky to have your grandparents alive. Ask them because, like, ask them a little bit. How was like who work, you know, when they were young, and probably they're gonna be able to tell you that, you know, before it was not by piece. And then I eventually all the work became about like piece. You you pay people by piece. So let me see here what Matthew saying. So the paying wage of set off several is cheaper than paying the so. Yeah, it's exactly that, you know.
Yeah, exactly that. So it's almost like that, I mean. And again, you have to it. That's the that's the mindset, Matthew, and you have to take that like
you have to see. You have to try to see where the guy was, seeing. He was like, okay, like having slaves is not a good idea, because you get there against you. Slavery in itself is a relationship of conflict, right? Like nobody. Nobody wants. Nobody volunteers to be a slave. Do you agree with me? I mean people are, I mean, the people who we slaved
in North America, especially like the U.S.A. You know it was like black people call
black Africans, and and and also people from the Caribbean who also came from Africa. So it's like you, Don't. People never volunteer. They were forced. They were like they're we. We're talking about a history of of of of violence against a population group. Right? So, and that means that you mean if you're going to force people to work for you, you're going to have to watch them, because
if they can get away with it hopefully. They will, because I mean, you know, I mean
slavery is the it's the ultimate kind of oppression that you can have against someone right. So that means that you're going to have to
in her surveillance. So if you can move to a a less conflictual, unless art, adversarial kind of relationship in the workplace that requires less surveillance, or at least it requires less surveillance of the type
of this type Here, this guy, this kind of guy here watching you. You don't need that. You can create all your forms of surveillance. You don't need to actually pay someone right? So
So you think about all the movies and all the books and everything that you've seen about, sir, about slavery in every farm, those big plantation farms in the Us. And also in Brazil
there was always someone watching right like, which was like the superintendent, or you know, the manager or the boss, or you know, yeah, in English, there is a word for that. Forget now, but like anyways, there's always a word to you. Know that person who what we use to watch it. This leaves right like. So there's always.
if you remember, in English you throw here in the chat, but like it, there is always a person who watches so so. But you got it. Is it clear? Matthew comments, questions, concerns, or anything or anything you want to add? Just going there if you want so anyway. So I mean. So
when you pay people by piece work again, it's almost like you. You.
You pushed that surveillance. that person watching you. You push that into self surveillance. It's almost like you Flip.
You go from someone watching you with a bad face like this, or you know that that they're gonna hit you, or be bit of you and
no, you, you flip that you put that in my mind. So now I don't need anybody watching me. I want to make as many P. As I can, so I can get paid, so it's almost like that. Compensation
becomes a surveillance agent. But inside of my head I don't need anybody, you know, checking on me. I will voluntarily make as many as I can, so I can make as much money as I can. So that was the one of the biggest strategies or the first big strategy in this
mode of production called capitalism for for us to move away from that low tax surveillance to high tech surveillance. So it's about.
Okay, it's clear. It's clear. So let's go. Okay, the second. Oh, and this is in case you are really interested in that, in the history of surveillance and in the economy and capitalism
here is like you. You're gonna find that, you know, in in capital, which is a book by Marx Volume one chapter 21. It's called piece Wage, and he's gonna explain exactly that based on his observations. Okay.
So the second strategy that that in that we see in this system called capitalism, it for you to kind of control workers. And but we thought they need to. Actually, you know, having to pay people to watch them is to outsource surveillance. So
I don't know if, like, take a look at here, I mean at the bottom of this orange.
I don't know if that rings a bell for you when you see that word doesn't, ring any bell for you, Pinkerton.
so Pinkerton people was one of the was potentially perhaps the first
detective agency in the world. Oh, in in North America, I would say in the world, because maybe being Britain in Britain, in a, in a, in a, in a, in the Uk. They had something, maybe there. But this one here was the first like a very famous, which later
became a global company. They exist to this day
to today, you know, if you they're still around, and they became a security kind of firm. Okay, so and like in in in in 19190519101920. We had a lot of strikes in North America, including Canada. For example, we had the
Winnipeg
strike at the time, so one of the worst strikes that we have ever seen in a history of capitalism. They happened in the beginning in the beginning of the nineteenth century and employers. They they outsourced surveillance. So what they did was they? They paid
like, You know, this detective a agency, and many others, because you know, that became a huge business that you know to spy on the labor movement. And and so the employer, especially like big employers like big factories that especially the steel industry in Ohio, in Michigan, you know, in Ontario. So they would pay. You know, people
those agencies to spy on on the labor movement, and and literally like you know, violent people like people were killed.
like you know, like the the employers, they would pay money to those agencies, and they would say, look, go, and get rid of those Union leaders, because they are costing us a fortune, and at the time our criminal justice system and our society was not what it is today, and people powerful people they could get away with whatever is even more use, like, you know, even more easier. I mean, it's too easier for people to get away today if you're powerful. But yeah, so it's. It's not even the police. Okay, Lucas is
not even the police. I mean, they were like private detectives, and of course, the police also help because the police is always on the side of the State, and the State was on the side of those like big employers, you know. But but again, but i'm talking here more like, you know, and and I I think I shared with you folks
before coming back to the of a. To do my Phd. I worked in the mining sector. and I worked for the second largest mining company in the world.
and in they. I don't know if I mentioned this in class, but I They had
like they have a huge contract and agreement with a big big global because this company is global. So they had, like a global, like a security company that do this do their security. So so this they do security of all the signs, all everything, all the workers. And it's so so good
that I don't know if I told you guys. But one day I was working for this company. This company had their headquarters are in Brazil because they started as a present company, and they were sold, and then they became like international and all they are the second largest mining company. The first one is Bhp. Billington, which is like a. It's a it's a a
ongo Australian company, you know, and then the second one is this company that it's called Valley, and they have operations in Canada. They have portage operations, Cisco, and they have Nicole operations in in Santbury, Ontario. They have a operations in in a gas in
Newfoundland.
They are everywhere in Canada, too, but anyways. But the point is so when they also work in the headquarters in Brazil, and a colleague of mine, he, you know, is a very violent country, very, very violent country.
so it's like one of the highest home side rates in the world. So a colleague of mine. He. He was going home late in the evening, and he got robbed like literally with a gun, you know, and they took his car, his laptop, his cell phone, his wallet, his everything.
And and then he phoned me because I was still at the company, and he phone my desk, my my phone. He was like Marcel. Are you there? So? Yes, I am. So look.
Can you call our boss and let her know that I was robbed, and that I am in this address here. I have no one. I have nothing so and then, and I was new in the company. So so he told me. Tell her, and she will know what to do.
and then and I told him called the police, and he was like. No, no, not gonna call the police. She will know what to do. Just call our boss. And then I call my boss. and she called. She told. She gave me a number. She said, Marcella, call this guy here. He is the
He is the director of our security. He's the global director. He's a present guy, but he's in charge of global security for this company. So call him. Call this his cell phone and let him know all the details. So people I call the guy
and
i'm not kidding you guys in like in in 2 h
they found the guys, my colleagues.
car wallet, cell phone computer, everything, everything.
And i'm not kidding, not. I mean.
It's just like in that. Meantime, imagine imagine we're let's talk about Canada. You You guys lose something right. You don't even got where you just you lost your stuff. You lost your cell phone, You lost your computer, I mean, if you call the police here in that meeting? Do you think that the police will do anything? And do you think that you know, if the police does something, do you think that they're gonna find your stuff.
Probably not right like Probably not. But like, Imagine this is Brazil
like we're talking about gangs. We're talking about violence up in the roof. We're talking about the home side. We're talking about poverty like slams where people can hide right like. And yet the Security Company, which is equivalent to
Pinkerton. They found that that guy stopped like in a matter of hours. That's for me.
that job that
that that my jaw, just like my jaw just like dropped. I was like, I can't believe this, you know. So, anyways, i'm saying this just to show you the power
of those
companies that they do security for other big global corporations. And the same is true about far Mcmurray, because I did research with Sara doro, the profit that you've sociology. And I could observe how a lot of the people work in the oil sense their security. And and again, global companies, i'll tell you more about the global oil sense later. But anyways, did you guys find this interesting? Are you kind of? Oh, my God, I was like, how is this even possible? Right? So
so, folks, there is actually a third way for for for the employers in capitalism they used
to optimize surveillance, which is high tech high technology. So again. So we call number one very basic, low, low tech kind of idea for you to kind of, you know, optimize surveillance. You pay them by piece, and then they internalize that number 2. You know you hire you outsource surveillance, and you, you know you find agents who work for you, and we'll protect your business, and and make sure that your employees are not involved in the labor movement. Not, like, you know, like giving you a hard time
and numbers, and also protecting your business. Because again, in the I sense here it's not it. It is about unions, but it's also about security of the facilities, because imagine I mean. Probably you're familiar with the I sense I mean, you know, I I mean like those facilities. If someone
I mean, there is always a risk that someone who tried to explode so, or something, or, you know, do something like, you know, nasty. So again, you need security because you're talking about investments that they are worth like millions, right? So hundreds of meetings.
and then high tech surveillance, which is that that's kind of what we you know. It's Usually, when we think about employee surveillance, we don't think about those 2 things we think about this high tech surveillance, right? So folks
do you guys work or no. Is there anybody here who works actually or no
people? Okay, Matthew works May. Okay. How do they.
Kathleen? How do they, Lucas? How Lily? How do they? What kind of an I I don't know if your your mind is going there. But by now you should be thinking about the kinds of like, you know.
low tech and high tech strategies that your employers they use to survey you. Is there any? Is there anything that your employers do do to survey you that you wanna that you want to share here. If you are feel comfortable, you know. And in well, the the first question is, which kind of naive I mean to ask, do they survey you for sure they do that, because that's that's about productivity, you know. So Matthew is talking about cameras, you know.
surveys like, okay, I like, drive through timers, security cameras. Yeah. So you guys, you get it right? So it's like, just about the transactions. You know, everything's logged into the system clocking to account like Kathleen Monitor mystery shoppers. Yeah, this is all surveillance, right? So so anyway, so okay, so here people.
So when you think about surveillance and the economy, it's about productive and profitability, please, Don't, forget that.
Okay. So surveillance workplace that it boils down to productivity and profitability. That's what it is right. So, however, there's problems, surveillance. They often fail, as you know.
they fail to achieve their goals
and and all quite often we we now know that surveillance is not fully effective. We've been discussing that. So so that's a problem, right? Because I mean it's not always effective so, and sometimes, instead of improving your performance, surveillance is surveillance pieces you off.
you know. So right, so surveillance sometimes, you know, expose.
like you know, he gets it, it goes beyond what he should do. That's another problem. So sometimes it's just to monitor your work, but in the end it monitors you as a person, it goes beyond what you know would be kind of
a reasonable threshold. Right? So
another problem that surveillance you Roads Trust, and that's very complex. Because if you don't trust your employer, if you don't like your employer, if there's no trust between you and your manager.
whatever kind of work you do. You're not gonna work. Well, you're gonna hate that workplace, and you're gonna try to find another job right? So. But surveillance sometimes it your roads trust so it can be problematic, too, you know.
So basically here, saying, you know that you know, like you work as a cleaner. And then through the scheduling app, My, my, my phone. Just get this away from the I can read it so my phone there's something on top of
could track me and make sure that I was on the correct house. Yeah, so. But you see, I mean it goes beyond right, because I mean
it's even like, you know. I mean, yeah, you know. So that that can be good, that that can be bad, too, right? So we can be like to invasive to intrusive right? So so this is interesting to see, you know.
another thing. So so if you compromise trust, usually compromise teamwork, which is a problem because, like team work is really important for productivity, and that's why you know all the jobs they require teamwork. It's about productivity
and and the employers people quite often. If you ask your manager. You know what it like. If you, if you actually have this conversation about surveillance, you for manager, it doesn't matter what kind of line of business you are. Your manager will tell you what don't really I mean the you know. Sometimes people who actually manage the surveillance in the workplace. They don't really know what they're doing. They don't they don't really know if they're not clear on the watts and the house and the wise of surveillance right? They don't take like a surveillance course.
They don't read about surveillance. They don't take the time to think about
So if you guys will be a manager in the future, or if you are already a manager somewhere again, be
like mindful that I mean surveillance can help you. But also can you know your role? Trust you can. You can. Actually, it can drive productivity up in the workplace, but it also depend on how you do. You can push productivity down right? So let me see here
the chat Selen up through giving a through giving availability. They have an idea of they some busy. Oh, yeah, you see. So they they go beyond right like they they start to kind of go a little bit beyond.
Yeah, you see our yeah. Well, Matthews saying, here is an example, like of of surveillance that it doesn't really work right? Like, yeah, the clients are talking system that doesn't really work.
Yeah, Selena. The same saying something that doesn't really work. So anyways, here, people, let's start the the article. This article is actually very easy. It's a bit too long for my opinion, you know, but I found it very, very interesting.
So it comes from this book called Building Power. So it's about like actually architecture, a history of architecture in the workplace. So the whole book
is discussing how.
in within the history of capitalism, how this system called capitalism, based on productivity and profitability, how the system change in the workplaces. So the building, the actually infrastructure, so that, you know, employees can be better monitored, and the productivity can go up.
So this is our this. This was written by
this woman named Anna. I can't for you to say her last name. You know too many, too many like, you know. It's too many crazy like, you know the J. I don't know. But anyways, let's call her Anna, you know. And so she wrote, and I actually the research is really well done. So she's a historian, and she's based at the University of of of Wisconsin in medicine in the United States. Okay, that's where she is. So. Look, it's a very. It's always long. It's. The idea is very simple.
The idea is, we go back to the beginning. Today we go back to the and of the of the nineteenth century and beginning of the of the twentieth century in the United States. And and then.
like, we had, like a like. All the sudden, we had the advent of mail and post office right like, you know. All of a sudden we had this technology called post office and males, which something that we you know, before we didn't have that kind of service. So she's talking about this beginning this chapter. You know how like, like all the sudden people start to write letters just like, now, we do emails. But before was letters and and the government, they had to kind of manage that
extremely high volumes of correspondence, like of mail of like career. Right so. And then, like you know, people like managing post Office across the United States, they became obsessed about the
How can we make sure that post office employees? They are not gonna steal from the packages, or still things that are being shipped through the mail. And how can we make sure that it's not even actually the most important problem that they had to solve was not even the theft
it was actually. How how do we make those people to process this extremely large amount of mail quickly? Right so, and then surveillance picking the option. So
so she describes in the art in the article like how the buildings were built, or change it in a way to accommodate a look out a look out like a little window where people could look others working so it's kind of still low tech.
If you go back in here, it's still this guy, you know, like the you know, like the at that time in the United States? No, by nobody was getting beaten up. But in the post office, at least.
But but it was like the idea of one person watching many right so so. And then they had those look outs, and then she describes, like the architecture, and how they change it them, and you know, and then she also talks about. So let's just go on here.
So so she also talks about like how you know the the lookouts. They were sometimes on the ceiling, sometimes on the side, so essentially was the whole chapters about it's it's daring us, sharing with us what you know, what kind of technology.
low technology which was a look out. You know, in the building, within the structure, how they use. They would rely on that to surveill workers and make sure that you're not stealing that they're They're doing their best, I mean, in terms of productivity, right so. And and she also talks about oh, sorry.
Well, I put this slide in here again. Why, why, I mean the whole chapter is just to show you that that was all about productivity. So why you? You would have look out again. Productivity to make people work more in less time. That's why I have to watch for you here. Have this time thing for you. So you kind of associate. Why watch productivity right so?
And but the the one of the highlights of the chapter, in addition to the like, the actual history, and she talks about different buildings is that, you know, like that look out gave visibility in the workplace. It's almost like that. Look out made employees working in postal and post office visible.
so they, whatever they were doing was visible and visible, and that whoever was watching could count
it could like, you know it could apply rationality, so I can, if i'm watching you. If I can't see what you're doing. If you are visible to me as an employee, I can count to you, I can time you. I can. I can check on you. I can, I can. I can. I could surveillance the all the definition of surveillance right so. And then, and I put this picture here of this window, and here is a bathtub. I don't know if you guys can see that, but it's a well, it's a kind of high end some luxury, you know
a bathroom, but it's more my my my goal with this picture here is to kind of make you associate visibility even in the toilet, so she's gonna talk a little bit about it like like more kind of in the later part of the chapter. How like a panoptica may see like a panoptica. So.
But the the difference in the lookout was that, you know, in some lookouts people could see that they were being watched in the Panopticon. Usually people would not see, and in the Post office people would know that they were. They would. They would. In some some lookouts people would see it right there. They're gonna watch it.
And and the idea was that even I can at some point in the United States that employers they removed the doors of the bathrooms. Okay.
like, because again, it like to void like you. You know, people from kind of being like loitering or like walking around just kind of soldiering. The language was at the time was called this so so
like soldiering, like, you know, like when you are walking up, you were kind of killing time. That's it killing time.
you know. So like. So you know, they even took the doors. I mean some workplace. Now this is considered like a human rights abuse. But back then was not so anyways. What about like full visibility, Full visibility? Right? So
let me see what else. Okay? So I would like to show you this because I I actually I just kind of it. It makes my mind go like you know.
So when I say that we look at capitalism people.
It's really about productivity and surveillance is a key component of making this system very productive. So look at this graph. This is just show you like how we in capitalism, how we increased in productivity. So this is what the bars, the globe, the group.
blue, green, whatever color you call this. You know the bars.
They are like a Gdp per hour worked. So if you get all the money that Canada, as a country produces
all that that money, the entire Gdp: okay, gross domestic
product. So you get all that fortune the wealth that Canada produces, and you divide that by the by the workforce. Workforce is people about 14 all the way to retirement age. So if you divide that fortune.
the Gdp by workforce, that's what you get in this graph. That's the output. So if we see in 1980 I was born 1980.
Our.
you know, per hour worked
like amount, was $34, so on the average, on the average.
a member of the Canadian workforce in 1980
they would produce $34 for their employer. That was not. That was not your paycheck. That was how much you as an employee would produce to your employer. Okay, so. And how is this calculated? Gdp divided by the work. Like the all the the work age, population, is this clear? That, like the the statistics behind this graph.
so so that was what we we as Canadians, we produced in 1,980. Look at now, people, this is this: this year 2,020, and this last bar is 2,021.
If you want to see, the actual source is underneath the the graph.
So now we as Canadians we produce on average, 54 bars.
So we as as like a as workers. we we became
much more productive. So our so when you look at like, so that's about capitalism in this this graph he explains the system which is about always more, more more and more right. So it's like
more output or less input more output. That's what the system is about. So your employer, if you work.
probably you know, if you work with cleaning, your employer wants you to clean, you want you to clean quicker and more houses or more places right like. And for this within the same timeframe. If you work at Mcdonald's, your your employer wants you to kind of have more customers within the a smaller timeframe. So that's kind of that's the drive of the system.
and this line in orange is the average hours work per week.
This is again the entire workforce is on average, so in
in 1,986 Canadians they worked on the average
37.5 h a week. Today
there was a little bit of a drop, and then it came back to
37.5 h a week. So we as a working class, if you want to call that way or we as work, we workers of Canada, all the people work.
We work on the average, about the same amount of time. However, we produce.
if my math is correct, if we do between 1980 and today 60 more. So that is what capitalism is all about, right? So i'm just see on the chat.
No, it it is Matthew. This is per year. It's like, oh, sorry it's it's. Yeah, it's like, Well, it's not per year. It's like, yeah, the the the the the math is based on year. So you get the entire the entire, like all the Gdp produced in that year, and you divide that Gdp by the number of people, so that would be, you know. But but but the calculation is per hour. You're right. It's per hour.
but it is on annualized. Do you understand what I mean by that? I mean it's per hour, but it is annualize. I mean it's like you. Get you. Wait! The whole year went by. You saw the fortune that Canada produces a country. You saw how many people worked in that year, and you divide that, and you saw how many hours they worked, and you divide that per hour, so you can get to that number.
So it is. It is per hour per work, day per hour per hour. Okay.
Okay, good. So
So anyways, this is to show you that. Look again it it it would be the equivalent of me asking you
people. You're gonna have to put in the same hours. But you're gonna have to produce 60% more. Think about If I asked you that I mean. you're gonna have to put in the same amount of time.
But you're gonna have to write 60% more assignments.
He would be like, my son. This is gonna kill us. Yeah, this is in dance people.
So that's why I mean, this is one of the reasons why we are all desperate, like with depression, with like, you know, with like anxiety. You know we are all kind of falling apart right like we we feel that there's no no time for anything anymore, and all we do is just like homework and work, homework and work work. And so it's pretty dense, and the system will keep moving like this, because that's how you know, and from one generation to the other we tend to adopt.
So it's always like, you know we we we with that, and that's the beauty of being human.
I mean.
we adopt. But on the flip side that comes with a huge toll on our mental health especially, and also our on our health.
But but the point that i'm trying to make is that this
is only possible because we have surveillance and surveillance. Keep changing
right like again. It's nobody. Nobody is watching like that. Now. You have clock in now you have, you know, a an app. Now you have this and that, but I mean but surveillance. Make sure that we
and now we get paid per performance, you know. But surveillance make sure that we we keep on track towards more productivity, more productivity.
So
yeah, yeah, you know, it is so. So now it's when I tell. I usually tell people look if you feel that you are desperate.
and probably you do feel because everybody feels that they're oh, my cellar! I'm anxious. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I mean, you know it's never endy. It's every day in a and the next cycle.
If you feel that way.
I have good news for you. It's normal, but not normal meaning. You should that you should kind of accept and embrace. No, it's normal. In this sense sociological sense. It is a social problem. It's not just to you. It's everyone. Okay.
And surveillance keeps us in. That helps us, you know. Keep that
moving like this.
So let's move to the second article. The second one people is this guy by this guy Here, Mark
Andre on today, and this one I kind of can say his name, and I I actually know this person, and and he is in Australia, and not in this university called Monash University, and he wrote this very short piece
to compensate. I gave you a long piece, and then there is this very short piece on automating surveillance. So let me just see the chat here before. Okay.
Yeah, okay, people. So look.
i'm gonna give. So now, you guys know, we've talked about it. Surveillance is getting very much automated, right like we see a lot of automation
like, you know, your Google phone is hooked to your You know your Google search on your computer is linked to your search, which is linked to your Youtube video, which is linked to your You know your TV, your Netflix, your you know, a Google Chrome, I mean, you know, we see a lot of out surveillance being automated right so.
And he is going to. He wrote this kind of 4 or 5 piece article to discuss.
Is it different if surveillance kind of automated surveillance any different than
like other kinds of surveillance, and his answer is going to be Yes, it is. Let me just see.
Oh, no problem. It's your cat. No problem. So look, so is surveillance, like you know, automated surveillance. Is that like different? Yes, it's gonna say Yes, he's gonna say that. Before we had the current level of an automation in surveillance
we subject to surveillance. We would internalize.
You know that kind of monitoring gaze. It's almost like, you know, Winter analyzed and surveillance worked as some sort of deterrence. Okay, i'm not gonna do this. because you know I'm being watch it, or I am gonna work hard because i'm being paid by piece, and people we want it, or how many pieces, and I am making per hour, and i'm gonna get paid based on that. So I internalize right so. And then he's gonna say that post automation
it's almost like prediction of with big data that we have prediction of human behavior. So we don't have deterrence. We actually prediction
re replaces the Terrence. So before the mindset was, I'm not gonna do this because, you know, I have that surveillance to me. I know that I am gonna get screwed. If I do that somehow, because of me or because of orders, it's almost like a deterrence. And now there's no need for deterrence, because we can actually
predicted human behavior. We don't need to stop that behavior. We predict it.
And then we we stop that behavior even before that. you know, realizes itself. So
so the example that he gives is like, you know he's gonna how does that happen? I mean this prediction of behavior. So he talks about, for example, like he happens through
hyper interactivity. So we have a lot of like, you know, surveillance. Now, it's hyper interactive. So we have everything connected like fridge. You're often your computer, your cell phone, your this, your dad, your app. Everything is so, you know.
So he used the example of Alexa. But it could be much, much more anything that you know that integrates stuff like cause. Alexa, for example, you tell Alexa turns off a turn off. Please turn off the the the light, and then it turns off the light. Alexa, please do that. So it's all integrated right, like, so I don't know if you guys use that I actually don't Obviously.
like the researcher of surveillance, I try to not not use those things. I barely have social media. I only use Youtube. I don't have any Instagram or twitter. I don't have any. None of that stuff, Facebook.
I don't have that stuff, and it's so funny because, like I,
my aunt in Brazil. I I had a
a little chat with her other day, and she was like Marcella.
Do you know, Alexa, I was like oh, No, I can't believe I she doesn't know what I do. She doesn't know. She doesn't know. She knows very little about me. but I was like oh, Jesus should. She has this thing? And then she was like, Look at this whole cool business. And then she was like showing me on camera how she would tell Alexa, you know I was like. Oh, I can't believe. I wish that I could share with her all you know that that conversation that we are having in class here and say, like, just like you know, don't use this stuff, but anyways.
so it's so. He he talks about like how this interactivity. How that facilitates prediction of behavior. He talks about. The convenience became surveillance. I mean right? So it's like it's it's overlapping. I mean you do things for convenience. So just like if you
if you try when you have time, try to do a Google search being while being logged off Google.
you're gonna see that you know your Google search does not save. Does not auto feel. It's not convenient.
you know. Actually, do this exercise lock off from Google, and then do a little research. You're gonna see that you're not gonna have all the perks that Google gives you in terms of convenience. You know, it's gonna be actually like kind of inconvenient to search anything if you're not logged in. Obviously they want you to be logged in so they can see your profile. They can match your profile, your demographics with your search. Right? So
so surveillance becomes, it becomes like choice becomes about surveillance. It's like, you know, like you know all. I'm gonna make this choice, and then, like surveillance, is, inform your choice and your choices, and informing surveillance and vice versa.
He talks about digital infrastructure being everywhere. Right so everywhere we find we are on Wi-fi, and you know all the time pretty much every website. Now they collect cookies. You know we have to accept, you know, all cookies, you know. If you don't accept, you can't really browse. You don't really have an option right? So it's like, you know. So he talks about this cascading logic of automation
which is taking over.
He doesn't give much in here, for example, that he he he builds on those ideas which kind of weekend if we think about, we can think of examples right like he talks about like even like
confidence and feeling good about ourselves becomes about surveillance. Actually, this one here he does not talk about. This is me
because it's me kind of building on the that article that we had about feminism. The apps.
It's like again to feel good now. Means to have an app for steps, you know, like in, you know, to feel good now means to control why you eat, and then you have an app that controls what you eat. So what you eat, so it's everything surveillance, right
like consumption become surveillance, I mean. Obviously, you You go on now on you choose something, and then they send you a recommendation, and and so what he's in that, he concludes. This 4, 5, you know. Page article even last.
Say that surveillance is a surveillance loses. Oh, I think there is a spelling problem here surveillance lose its frame right like so
it's like now it's frameless. It's everywhere. There's no borders. It's.
you know it's everywhere. So that's how that's Where so. Automation. It's almost like, you know. You take off any kind of border limitations of surveillance. There is no more limitations.
also helps that. Here's Selena speaking also helps that everything is typically connected to one account. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we mean that you're you forget saved. Yeah. So try to, you know. Try to operate without that convenience, and you're gonna have to remember all your passwords. You're gonna oh, it's gonna make your life miserable
like for convenience. Some sites or apps. They use convenience by letting you sign the E. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Because you you never remember that the the password, anyways, right. It's like. So again. It's like it's almost taking over right like.
So people I know. Now we're going to cover what we have like 7 min. I'm gonna start covering my research with Sarah Doral in for Mcmurray, and we actually well, I published. We've actually I have a a student of mine who took a course with me in social problems
and a very good student.
and the and she wanted to get some experience like academic research experience, because she wanted to do her masters in criminology, and I offered her, I said, Look, I have this old article that I wrote a while ago.
I submitted for publication. It got rejected, I mean at the the editors. They asked too many, too many changes, and I said it, and never had time to go back and change.
Would you like to apply those changes and help me improve the article, and then you come as my co- offer. And then she said, Yes, and then we actually did this together, me and my students. So we published this article. So the research was done me and set Professor Sarah Doro. But the article was me and my student actually okay.
some random person who I met in my class. Very good, by the way. So anyways, let me take you to far Mcmurray. Probably you guys for those of you who don't know what far Mcmur is about. Not for Mcmurray is a town
in Northern Alberta. It's about 6 h from here, driving up north and there we have extraction of guess and
veteran, the bitumen or pitchman, with no entrepreneurs in English. Very well, but it's like a Benjamin is like. It's kind of a it's a kind of a a a material that kind of it's kind of oily kind of material. It looks like kind of a a chunk of dirt.
and then they process that, and that becomes actually oil right like in the gasoline and and all that kind of stuff. So so it's that it's also called there's sense or oil sense. So, anyway, so Sarah did research in there
with people who do flying fly out some, some, some of your parents. They do fly out of your spouse or your friends. They do fly flying, fly out, and I I tagged along with her doing research as an I research assistant for her. And then I because i'm interested in surveillance, I I ended up gathering data on surveillance.
So so there is a lot of survey like people who work in oil sand. They do flying fly out. They stay at work camps a lot of them. They stay at work camps, and and then I I I also stay at work camps
because of my research with her. So I I went there twice with her, and in my past life, when I worked in the mining sector, I also stayed
one trip that I went to the Amazon for us to see some, you know, extraction of iron. I also stayed at work camp as an employee. So anyways, I, you know, and I always kind of watch surveillance right. So so let me let me show you very quick. So the data.
So this is the oil sense. Every little building that you see here. It's a work camp.
and there's a lot of air strips because employers, they fly their employees in there, so there are many. There's the farm. There's the far making Mari official airport. And then there are other kind of strips where, you know they like private jets that are charted by the oil companies. They bring the employees.
So I collect this data, people in 2,015,
and with Sarah. And so it was about 40 interviews with people who work and stay at work camps. So I interviewed housekeepers, cooks, people who actually work in the work camps, and also the oil oil employees who do flying fly out
Well, everybody does flying fly out, even the cooks, the the the housekeepers, but I, but they work. They work in the camps, but I also interview people work out at site, you know.
and I also did a lot of participant observation. You know. Physical trace amounts like when you kind of you know you kind of follow things. You you watch things, and you kind of go following them, you know, like a portrait to talk to someone documentary. And I was in social media analysis.
There is a little bit of a limitation in this project that I give Sarah because our initial intention was not to gather data about surveillance. So that was up to mistake. Okay.
So let me see where we are at. Okay, 3 min. So anyways, i'm gonna stop here, and then i'll tell you what i'm gonna tell you exactly how you know the work camps, how they do surveillance on the on the employees, and that involves
housekeepers. It involves pornography, controlling pornography, controlling, you know, labor movement for not all sorts of crazy things. So try to be here. Try to watch next video or be here for next class, and we can talk more about it. So i'll stop here, and then we're going to come back next to class, and on Thursday, and we're going to wrap up this so I can share with you what is going on in the oil sense, and you're going to be.
You're going to be terrified. You're going to be Mars. I can not believe this is happening. Okay, so this is it for now people.
I think we are almost there. So you guys have a very good just to where to check is.
You guys have a very, very good.
They rest of your day. Stay. Well, I have off hours in case you need me. I'm gonna just finish here. Have some water, and then i'm gonna move. And you guys have a wonderful day. Take care of yourselves. Okay, and come back to me if you need anything in off hours.
Thank you. People have a great day. Thank you very much.

Mar 9

"Hi, folks, do you guys hear me? Do you see me?
I change a little bit my set up here, so i'm not sure if you can. Okay, Great. Okay.
So let me just share my screen.
Do you guys see, like the full screen like the full Powerpoint? Or you see my notes.
Hey, guys, do you guys see? Like the full thing? Or you see my notes?
Okay, the whole part. Okay, yeah, okay, that's good to know. But I that's not working yet.
I want to make it in a way that
I don't need the notes. Well, I don't even actually have notes.
Let's see if we can find okay, nothing not better. Yeah, not it's better because I I okay, perfect.
Hey?
Let's see who is here for you guys?
Yeah, that's just like a little bit. I think we don't. The time is not up yet. Okay.
one more minute.
Hey, folks, let's get started. so I hope everybody is doing well. I hope you guys are taking care of yourselves.
Okay. So here, so last class, when I finished I was actually telling you folks about
our research that I did in for Mcmurray, and that in like I I I did research in there.
They Originally the research was not about surveillance. I was doing research as a research assistant to Professor Sarah Dorl
and I was helping her interview. People who are on flying fly out working out in the oil sense region.
And and I think I told you like that. There is a lot of like, you know. People like a lot of the people. They work remotely. So they come from Alberta, BC. And Ontario. Those are the main provinces in Canada feeding, you know the oil sense. So we're gonna be seeing in Ontario, and also some people from North Dakota, Texas, even Americans, because they also work with like oil and gas in there. So they come to work with oil and gas in here.
So I was in there, you know, in work camps, interviewing people, mostly men like
90% of the flying fly out people. They're males white males. So, anyways, so I did this research with her. And then, when I was doing the research, I realized that surveillance is a big thing, right so, and I also shared with you that I did work in a mining sector myself.
like in my past life, and I also I stayed once in a work camp in the heart of the Amazon forest in Brazil, in my own country. There I I was not doing flying fly out. But I was like working corporate in the office, but I I
you know, once I had the chance to go and visit all the mines, and and, you know, see the operations and everything.
So, anyways. But this is about the work camp. So, people, there's a lot of surveillance in surveillance happening in the work camps in pharmac memory. Okay, a lot. So just to give you this is some just context for information. Again, when I say surveillance for this research here. It's about gathering and creation of data on populations. In that case, people who actually work in for Mcmurray and they get to stay in work camps.
And just again for context, they like remote work. You know, I said, in the O sense region it had
just context for you. So that means that some people you know they go, and they stay 21 days in form. I can, Murray, in some work camp, and during the day time they go work at all that site.
and then are some people They do 14 days in there, and some people do 21 days in there and 7 days out back home somewhere. Some people do 14 days in there and 7 days out. Some people, do, you know, 10 days on like there, and in 4 days or 9 days or 5 days out. I mean, it depends.
So there's a lot of like shifts. Different shifts depends on the occupation. It depends on your like contract. It depends on a lot of things. So like the worst shift is 20. Yeah, I agree, or you you are familiar with that, you, you know, like you are. Yeah, because look one thing
out there, and how many days you go back home. Another thing is your actual shift, like in there, and then they have 12 h on to 12 h off. They also have. Sometimes they have 24 h shifts, so you you get like. So when I talk about shift. So we're talking about 2 things.
No, no, no, Jessica, no, absolutely not You're not going to be. This is just for you, because I mean, I I know that a lot of people here know they are very familiar with that. You might have friends and everything who who do that kind of work. But I just want for people we're not familiar. So we have about 60 work camps.
and it's about 2527,000 workers. Look people. This is like like recent data, because, like we have like in 2,000, and
like 14,
1314, it was almost about 50,000 people.
so like, you know, like there is like this region is marked by boom and bust. So we have cycles like, you know, so like, you know, sometimes some years there's like many more people, some so like, you know, this is more recent data. It's like after the fire, and then after the fire. The economy is not doing so great, and also like with a lot of Alberta, is getting a lot of restrictions oil sense companies
on environmental like stuff. So we just I see as a problem, because
I don't know I mean I especially when we. when we are not involved with the oil sands. All we can think about is that this is dirty. This is like, you know.
like. But when once you actually get to know the area and you like like I did, and you get to interview the people who, working there. You realize the importance of this economy, and you realize, like I mean, like in in the the the the the oil sense, the burden oil sense.
It employees about 140,000 people direct employment and indirect employment, so that means, like 141, 150. Let's make it like that's round up 150,000 families that depend on that that income.
and and sometimes I see the government
I absolutely I I respect. I think we need to take care of the environment and everything. But I I see, like the governments in Canada, and also in the United States, and I was wearing the
to push a clean energy agenda, which I think it's important. but like what they're doing is they? They want to phase out the dirt
before we actually have
something like really reliable in clean energy, which I I see as a problem. I think that we should be investing like, let whatever we have continue until we get something to replace, because, as a researcher, I kind of think back
like
what's gonna happen to those people that I interviewed right like, you see, like you see that, like, you know, a lot of restrictions. You you see a lot of the investments in the in the oil, in the oil sense kind of getting decreased. So you you think about, you know
you think about like how how hard it is for people who don't have a job, or anyways, I don't know if you guys are like, what i'm saying is like, I think we have to be careful about
like, you know, you know, getting rid of stuff before we actually have something, because
we're talking about human life right like that. People get their script, and
and people need to feed their fans. Right so. But anyways, yeah, in Valence, I see you here one of the things that I saw in the oil sense just going a little bit beyond the surveillance aspect of it
is how it's a very hard. It's a like People thought a lot about for Mcmurray as being for for for me money
as as if this is a place for you to make lots of money.
which indeed, you can make a lot of money there. However, that money doesn't come cheap, that doesn't come like easy. There are a lot of the
I have the stats here, but I do have them with me. My files a lot of the money that you doing for Mcmurray is over time work
so like. So it's a lot of over time, and that comes with a price tag very big price tag, because, you know, people are working, working, working, and then and then to compensate
for that fatigue for that stress for that, you know, when they go back home they buy a lot of things for their families, and that kind of create, you know, as like a kind of a bubble, an economic bubble. So people actually, even though they're making a 100 and
2,000 30,000dollars a year. They are actually on that. So that surprised me a lot. In the interviews with Sarah Doro, like a lot of the people working for making worried. They are in debt. They have huge debts like loans and everything because I mean they weren't. When you make them more money you spend, and in a lot of them they kind of. They're They don't like that environment more because I mean, there's a lot of divorce involved. I mean, people start to working there, and then they divorce from their and then, like family derails, it gets very complicated. So people want to stock.
So everybody that I interviewed in there. And if you guys have classes, Sarah Dori can ask her all the people in the oil sense. They have a 5 year plan. When you interview them you ask them so why why do you do this work, you say? Oh, it's just 5 years, and then i'm done.
I'm going to pay my mortgage. I'm going to pay my this, My, that, and then i'm done. And then people, the reality is that they're never done so. I've met people in there who they are in the year Fifth.
you know, like tams, even like one guy who has been working the a while like Fifth, 15 Year Plan. So I I interviewed one guy who has been doing pharmac for about 40 years, so it's like it's really really hard. Let me see what you guys are putting on the chat here.
So, Jessica.
So I also the invest more money neglecting the order. Yeah, but that's the thing, Jessica. We have to be careful. I mean me coming from the oil, I mean, I did. Oh, oh, sorry I came from the mining sector, actually the only commodity that the company that I work for they did not have was oil.
But I can tell you, with like certain, like with some, some, some knowledge, I mean, like with like like those companies. They like mining companies. They are investing very heavily
in a clean energy, because they know that. I mean, they know that eventually like that we need to to clean. You know we need it's like it's even like for them. They realize that that can be even more profitable than extracting resources from the land, because when you extract resources from the land.
there's a lot of liability you're talking. It's like too heavy equipment. It's too expensive. It's not easy to do that that kind of business. So the companies themselves the mining companies. They are trying
to invest money elsewhere and develop new technology. So I see if you actually go, and if you pick any of the oil Sense company, any of them like a imperial or a scenario or shell, or you name it, and you go, and you read. They are
their annual report that they put on their website, which is the report that they offer to investors that they put in the stock market. You're gonna see that like they? They are investing a lot in clean energy.
but it's a process right like you can't like it. It just like you. You know the cure for HIV Aids. I mean. Now you're starting to see research that say that you know people can get cured. So it's a process. So they are investing a lot on it. But
you know it's like it's not that they don't want to move away. They do, but it's it's just like it doesn't. It's not like, you know.
but anyways.
But then your comments Really, it's really interesting for us to think about it. So I think that people i'm See here, I think that also relates to the problem of investment. They're trying to phase out oil for them events. Yeah, but that's that's what exactly what I see as a problem shi like when you.
because I mean for for business people, for let's say for politicians, it's just like their political agenda, but for people on the ground. And that's why kind of my heart kind of I. So for a little bit, because
people actually, I mean on the on the politics is like, okay, I force you to do this and that. Okay, good. But on the ground people are losing their jobs and and it's that can be.
and I don't know if you guys are homeowners. I'm not a home owner in Alberta, but my friends are, and they tell me that I, a friend of mine, actually told me that she has a but she has several buildings in the sea. She's a landlord.
and she was telling me that her gas price
went from $8,000 2 years ago to 20
$3,000, so like, you know, probably like Alberta, where we have guess to to for us, for people who are homeowners, probably your parents or some of you to be paying that amount of guess. It's like, you know, when we actually get that we have gas in here, I mean it's just like
I don't know I mean it's it's it, Anyways, i'm not saying that I mean you know it. It's complex, because when you talk about climate change, and you talk about all you and stuff on for like a
fossil fuels.
it immediately gets very back atomic. If you you will pose or you support. And then, like 2 people, they start to fight right like I kind of try to see it's more complex than that, so I think I don't know. But anyways, this is not my area any more. You should be, but not anymore.
but but something that i'm just bringing up to you guys here, so it's not life in the form of it's definitely not easy. So this is like the people that I that I that I was interviewing so 85% of them. They were males. 70% married, 70% from Alberta, a lot of them they have a trade certificate. I mean, they don't have really like a law of education.
but they do make lots of money because of over time. I i'm not a problem that I saw in there. I, in addition to the debt, was alcoholism and drug use and abuse. Because again for you to put up with that life where you are confined, it's pretty much like prison, right like it's not easy. So
let's see. I think that's pretty much context for you guys. So I thought I told you so in this article that I published with my student, me and Sarah, we did 40 interviews in depth interviews with people working there and staying. Yet you know.
work camps. I also did participant observation. It was actually ethnographic to work. When you go in there you'll live with them. You watch them, and you, you know you take notes and everything, and you also interview them.
So I was like also looking at documentaries, social media, and all those things right like again. The original purpose was not to do research on surveillance, but because that was.
you know, under my per view, and also because I was pay attention to that. I I ended up writing about it.
So look.
people, when you think about surveillance, workplace, surveillance, and for Mcmurray.
which is the topic of like last class in today's class like like you as a worker being surveilled by your employer. When you think about that in for Mcmurray you gotta think about the role of of those workers that do not necessarily. They don't really work for the
out at site in the actual mining operations. They They are actually
people who Derek. They're almost like hospitality people because they work in their work camps. They are the cleaners, the housekeepers, the cooks like paramedics. Each work camp has a paramedic, and because we're talking about like a huge work camp, some of them they have even up to 5,000 people. So you need to provide a parenting on site.
So so so that's where this. That's where the bulk of the surveillance happens. Okay.
So it's a of all cameras, too. But like a lot of the surveillance happens is like the people who work in the in the camp or in K. A. Camp. They watch the workers, and they get to know their workers, and they get to. Oh, there's something suspicious with Marcel. She came because it live in Pharmac Mur is very regimented.
so you know, when people like you know the shifts, you know. Okay. Now, you know, we have a wave of people like Tweet at the canteen. So now you know everybody's coming home like home, like or camp.
Now people are leaving to work out that sign. So you know the the routine is very, very solid so. And then, if you see something outside of the routine that becomes suspicious, right? So so let me another. So a lot of the the surveillance. I'm: just see something here. Okay. Yeah.
So a lot of the surveillance happens like with like dogs they have like dogs that sniff all the the the entire facility, including bedrooms so like in in in some camps.
especially in the larger camps, for some core and cnrl they have, like. Usually it's true people per room is like a a student residence. So it's 2 people per room so, and and and some camps. Of course, if you are a manager, you get to stay alone, and some camps. They just put one person per room. It depends a little bit the arrangement, but anyways, but the dogs they actually come inside and they snee for drugs. Okay, so that's a major consent concern.
And like the housekeepers, this is this part gets funny, and if you guys have questions or comments just put on the chat. Okay. So the housekeepers they they when they clean the rooms like, usually like the room they have what they call Jack and Joule, so they would kind of like, you know they share this bedroom.
and but anyways, when they they
clean of the drain especially, they, they always look for long hairs. And here it gets really interesting. They ask Why? Because in most camps like you cannot bring women.
or vice versa. If it's a man. If it's a women born, you cannot bring men so you can't like you can't bring people in there like to hang off or to have sex with. Right? So so, housekeepers they're always looking for long hair, if this is like. But most most people who are there, They're men so housekeepers. They assume that every man has short hair, and then and then they they look for long hair in the drain.
which means technically, would mean that I mean that you are like you know, someone a woman is showering with you, but we all know that I mean
that's not. I mean you can have short hair right. You can be like me, a woman, and you have short hair, and you can be, you know you can be a gay person with that you you, you know you're gonna have sex with another person, you know. I mean it. So, anyways, they have those very clear rules.
But there, we know that society doesn't they they, they, they they abide by the fish, show norms of society, or those big norms which is head of sexual arm. You know, kind of like. It's a very rigid standards for masculineity and femininity, and they they use those norms to apply surveillance. But we and you we know that I mean
that you know you can be a woman. It can be short hair. You can be a man. You can be a gay person right. So it's like. So so that. But anyway, so. But that's how they kind of frame the surveillance right like a lot of the housekeepers they don't know
are actually, they don't know that they are being used as a a as a as a agent of surveillance. They don't know that they don't realize that what they're doing They know that they are looking for things, but it's not very rationalized for them, so I I had the chance to. They didn't know, like like the housekeepers.
every day in the morning, at 90'clock they have a meeting
where they're gonna just meet with like the the manager, and they're gonna discuss, you know, discuss things like about their their work, just like you would do in a restaurant like before you actually start serving. Perhaps if you want me. If you guys worked in a restaurant like you have to gather together, your manager will go through the menu specialty. She's like just like normal kind of routine. So they do that, and I was able to participate in their meetings for a couple of days, and and I could see that they don't already know that they are surveillance
surveillance agents, but that's the reality. That's because that that's what they are. And the managers tell. Look if you guys see anything suspicious. You report back because they don't want to have any travel in the work camp right? So
another so and so this is the drain. This is like like, Why do I have this plastic bag here like the garbage bag.
like the the all, the the the you know, like one of the things that the housekeeper do when they they go, go go clean. The room is like they. They changed it. We they take the garbage out and the garbage purposely is in a transparent bag plastic bag.
So why? Because then they can pull that stuff, and they can take a look and see if they, and then they look for what they look for condoms.
They look for drug per holding. I see English, but kind of feel, you know they they look for drugs. Things like you know, things that people use like, you know, shrink string, or you know anything that people could use to, you know, inject or or sneak drugs whatever. So they they look for do potential drug things. They look for alcohol, you know they look for things that that are banned that they are not allowed in the work camp.
or any kind of evidence that that thing was around at some point. So that's why it's transparent.
so that facilitates visibility and surveillance. Right? So another thing here that they do like that's why I have the bar in here. Let's see what you guys are
Yeah, Para: for now. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly that. So that's what they look for. Thank you. And then there's this bar Here I I oh, I had a lot of time, a lot of my field work Experience
was hanging out at the bar and actually drinking with people there like hanging out and interviewing them. Obviously, I mean this people. We have ethics for the call, so every interaction that I had in there I had to like, read to them my consent, form and everything. So everything is like, not sketch or anything. It's like. They knew that I that we were in there trying to understand life in pharmac murmur, okay.
So anyway, so I was at the bar many, many, many times. And one thing that I learned is that, like like some camps they are. They are called dried.
They're just so dry. I'm sorry they're called dry, and some caps they're all wet, so wet camp right camp. What's the difference in a dry camp. There's no bars and do, and alcohol is completely entirely banned
like in in a. In a wet camps there is usually a bar, and you can go have a a beer in the bar, but you cannot bring alcohol to your dorm. Okay, so you have to. You have to stay at the bar.
and what I notice like doing, talking to people in the watching, like people's behavior. And everything is that the bartender.
with often usually a woman. Okay.
usually a woman. They they they kind of control. They are. They are also surveillance agents because they control. They gather data on how much people are drinking. So let's suppose I am an oil worker, and I I sit in there, and every day I go there. Every day I go to have a drink that doesn't that doesn't sound that doesn't look very good.
That, indeed, potentially potentially indicates some sort of alcoholism. Some sort of like, you know, like abuse, like, you know, alcohol views, so they keep an eye on me, and usually they don't give more than 2 pints. So you have like 2 glasses, and that's it. They don't give you more than that. And if you kind of start to kind of you know, bugging them, they can throw you walls, and they can report you to security, and you can get banned from camp.
which is technically a huge problem. Imagine, if you live in admission and you work out there, and you like camp for you is the only place where you can stay right like. So so it's impossible for you to like some some mines. They are like almost like in shell. Albion, which is like
shell, is like the company, and now the is the operations like it. It's like about a 100 kilometers into like to the north, so you can't really live in farming and go working there. So you have to stay at camp.
So if you get banned from camp, I mean that it it's pretty much the same equates to being laid off right, because I mean it's impossible for you to actually do the work. So so a lot of surveillance happening here. And one day I just see the chat.
Yeah, it's a surveillance. I mean it's, it's, it's a it's it's a we can call Valencia. The the transparent bag, a surveillance, a surveillance tool. It is a tool of surveillance. It is and the person the housekeeper is the surveillance agent.
Okay. So the bag is a tool of surveillance that you use to do that transparent bag. And and you know, and wondering, and let me see why I was wondering if I if a thing could also.
No, it's usually well, we could.
I think, could be. But usually we call people agents, and we call, like the the the the technology technology of surveillance or 2 of surveillance. Okay, so for the thing, either technology or tool, and for the people agents, agents. Okay.
anyways. So let me people listen to this. If you guys are, there is this interesting, or this is like super boring. And then you guys are tired already like
folks. Are you guys there?
Okay, Good. So i'll keep going. Then.
Yeah, the companies they side. Matthew. They do sign that. Okay, okay, good. You guys are there? Okay? So look. So one day, let me tell you this: you're gonna love this story. One day I was actually sitting at the bar I was drinking, and then this guy came. I won't. I can't say I'll be like a little bit. I won't give all the names and everything because I have to protect this person's identity.
and this person, anyways, I mean. So this guy I saw a guy, 2 guys, an older guy and a younger guy.
and and they were there. They looked very kind of, you know, open for conversation. I was like, okay, hey? Hi, how, how? How's it? How's going? Did you guys have a good day today? And and then they were like, oh, hey, actually, yeah, we did. We stayed the whole day year. I was like, oh, really Why? Because I mean you're supposed to go work out that side. You said, No, we actually work for. Tell us I was like, oh, tell us the Internet, provider they were like, Yes, tell us the Internet provider, it's like, oh, good. So but why, what you guys are doing here? And then they were like, okay, Palace
is the primary or the main, the biggest provider of Internet. Telephone and also TV to like most work camps in Pharmac Murray. I was like, oh, this is great.
And i'm sharing this information with you
because later, because this I mean I I order. I anyways I like Technically, I would have to anonymize the name Dallas. The reason why i'm not anonymizing. I'm i'm giving out the identity of the company. Here is, I can't say that I did some of the people that the company asked, because I actually later I found a report
that a public available report that has all the information that i'm sharing here. So i'm so that means I can share, because it's publicly available. So, anyway, so tell us this all the you know.
goveraging there
and then those those people. They were like, okay, so. And then I was like, okay, you know. And then eventually I can't remember exactly how. But we we start talking about like internet surveillance.
And I was like, oh, so I do. You guys do like, do you guys do surveillance on the workers here, or you know, or you you monitor? They were like, Well, we don't do it like actively okay. But we do have, like, you know, algorithms in place, that they control for certain things.
And I was like, really. And then the guy was yeah, really. And then he pulled his cell phone
and he said, okay, give me the name of a work, a work camp. And then I I told them like one, you know, work camp. and then it's like. Now give me a room number like, you know, from whatever to what you gave me a a range for numbers, just pick a number, and then I picked the number. That was a room number, and then the guy had the nap
in his cell phone. He could go inside of the app he could select which work camp I gave him, and and he would go in there, and he would be able to see like just like
through, just like by doing a few, a few clicks he could see what the person inside of that room was watching.
They could see the logs of channels that the person watched in the best, you know, whatever, like time period, they could see what Internet sites that person had browsed.
you know, and they could see, you know, like if that person was logged in on the Internet. Yeah, I mean, they could see everything, you know, like the IP address, I mean. They could see everything, you know. And then they said, I mean they had. What they have in place
is reports, I mean, they have like algorithms that tell them if something suspicious happened. And then I got very interested in in what I mean, how that worked, and then and then it came to a point that the guy told me. Look! And now it's too much information. I cannot share more than what I have shared. But what I can tell you
is, and then I was like, oh, is it about pornography? Because I don't know why that came to my mind, and I was like oh, maybe you know, like the work camps. They don't want the people to watch pornography. That's what I thought. I don't know why, you know. And then he was like No, Marcella, you are very naive.
Pornography is actually wonderful. We want our people to work, is staying at work camps to watch pornography.
and then i'll i'll. I'll report exactly what he told me, because this is published actually, because, like you know, like this is like a if their watch pornograph is good, because I mean, he said something those lines. It comes them down. They're going to be like all kind of do style and happy. So, for pornography is actually good. We don't care about that.
And then I was like, okay. So if you do, what what the hell do you care about? I mean crimes, and I was like No, really. And then he gave me a little bit. He didn't give me details, but he told me. It's. You know, he has to reflect labor movements, unions and in sabotage so like, anyways like the
oil companies, I mean their primary concern when they do Internet surveillance in there, and they want to see what people are watching, you know, is the fear that their operations will get sabotage, because I mean Again, as I said last class, we're talking about millions of hundreds of meetings of investment, and you know any explosion any any sabotage can cost a fortune, right? So so
that's the main concern that they have. And they also have concerns about the unions and people like, you know, labor movements that could be a huge threat for them. So so that's what they look for, you know. So let me just see the check, because I see you guys are. You're writing here. So let's see.
Yeah, that's all it. Yeah, Valencia. That's why I mean, I I also understand. I mean, I yeah, I forgot. If thank you for bringing this up. I mean people, I mean, I understand the surveillance, especially regarding drug use and abuse
and the alcohol, because again, it's like a. Indeed! It's you're you're like. Imagine if you are the the the driver of those big trucks that you know we're talking about trucks that they they haul, like, you know, 2030 tons of 50 tons of of dirt.
I mean in the those trucks are massive. You can't drunk right like that. There is a there is a real security, like a ha like occupational health and safety problem. If you are drunk right, you can kill people. You can kill yourself right? Like. So key More.
Okay. And rose. Yeah, the universe was dry there.
Okay, yeah, that that's interesting. I didn't know about that. I did not know this.
Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly. So it's. It's very strict people.
Another form of surveillance is you ring, test, and here there's potential violations on on behalf of the companies, the other companies, because sometimes the problem. Here again, I understand that I mean, you can't be, you know, high on drugs and
and in working that environment because you can kill people. I totally understand that. But what I don't understand is that, like companies, they could come clean about it. They could say, look people, you! I'm going to hire you. You're going to work for me, and i'm going to urine task you every time that you arrive, or i'm going to randomly.
You're in test you or I'm gonna, you know. I'm gonna you. I mean, they could be very clear. But they're sketchy. They don't tell people. and and so they catch a lot of people, and I personally believe that I don't need to be. Sketch about it just like to be clear. Just tell people look. I'm gonna be testing you all the time, so like. So just make sure that you don't have any drugs, because you know, just come clean, but they don't. They make it in a very sketch way, and that can be problematic.
and even like the way that they, it can be programmatic, because I mean, you know, people people know what's going on, and and that's not comfortable. If you are a worker right like that, that, just like I said last class, that surveillance breaks the trust right? Like
also under problems that in Canada, cannabis is okay. I mean, it's legal now. And a lot of those people when they go back. They're not no longer in the or sense. They go back home.
you know. They have to stop drinking, and the people who do use cannabis or alcohol in their recreational time. They like one day before it's almost like
like a 2 days or 3 days before you know, depending on how much the drug stays on your system. You have to stop using the drug, because you know, because that can, you know Sometimes you might flying, and then they might demand that we we're in. You're in tasks right when you kind of land, and then you might be caught. So what i'm trying to say here, get. Since the country has legalized certain drugs
like employers, they have to. Also. you know they have to be. They have to be aware of that. They can. They can't like act as if you were a criminal, because in the interviews what I learned is that some people
they kind of. They are entitled to, let's say, a week
of of like. Their rotation is 14 days in 14 of 4 or 7 days out. So the first day. They're pretty much traveling.
The second day they're dead. They're super tired the third day. There they have to do their, you know, like
like things like, you know, grocery shopping go to the bank. They have to do like, you know, personal kind of, you know, personal organizational things like do. Some ran, run some errands, and then in the day Number 5. That's when they actually can enjoy themselves.
And then they the day number 6. They also technically couldn't join themselves, but they can't really do anything like in terms of like alcohol or cannabis, because you know, that would stay in their system. They would be caught because they number 6. They're they're going the they number C 7. They have to go back. So you guys understand what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is that because of the surveillance works in a way
that intrudes in your life in such a way that cuts your time. You know again.
A lot of it's like the people who use like, even in Canada. I think that the it's about only 10% of the population who actually use cannabis so, or you know. But alcohol is something that more people use right like alcohol is more so anyways. But regardless. The point is that the surveillance happens in a way that
you know takes away your work, life balance, you know. Let me see what you guys are saying here. So
Oh, yeah, You're Anita. You're talking about the missing of indigenous women, right like, for like a who they disappear from their communities, and they often quite often appear as a victim of violence, or as a victim, or or sometimes unfortunately, like killed right like so. Yes, you're right.
But the honestly I need that that's not even their concern.
their concern in for me to Murray is, it's just like that they want. They They want to keep things very orderly. It's no I did I didn't see like a human rights preoccupation on their side? Unfortunately, you know.
Yeah. And then for some drugs in the system.
Yeah, cause I so it's it's complex, you know. I mean again, I i'm not. I don't really understand like how drugs I mean. I know you know I don't really know those things, but I know that they they were complaining a lot in danger views, you know.
Yeah, so agree or here's kind of clarifying cocaine's 3 days crack. I don't know how many math also. Yeah. So you know some drugs. They wash away very quickly. Some don't.
but but according to the people, especially those that take their jobs really serious. They really need the job they freak out. And normally, people Normally.
people who work on rotations. I don't know if you've ever done this kind of work
like 2 days or one day before you actually go back. That anxiety keep kicks in. I see that in Pharmac Murray. I saw that, and I also see cause I now, you guys know, I do research with correctional officers in prison, and they also work kind of rotations and like, you know, and that what I saw in for Mcmurray is also true to the officers.
So like the your last day, you don't really get any rest. It's just like that anxiety. You kind of getting ready to go again, you know.
So like, yeah, people agree. Or here he is saying that it's the information is really reliable, right? Like. So that yeah, they have research. That's it's good.
Yeah. And and look, I need a surveillance. Yeah, but that's the thing I need. A surveillance is caring, and that's the point in farming. I saw that a lot of the people who were doing the surveillance. They are the people who are actually
caring for those workers who are there. So here we see this huge overlap between to care is to do surveillance. Let's suppose you're going to care for your grandparents.
What? What? How do you care for them? Watch them. You make sure that they are eating property. You cook for them. You make sure that they are there like their clothing screen. You change them when they need help. I mean, you know what I mean. Like to survey, we scare, but you know, so we have this romantic idea that that care it means
just like love and and good things, not necessarily to care to search, to survey, or someone means to care, and vice versa, and sometimes you know it. So here, what's what? It was nice about it. They got me thinking about like the overlaps between surveillance and care, and how, you know, like in kind of kind of
like removing that romantic light the side of caring.
Let's see through your say here.
So you're saying that Yourene, cannot to to all right like cannabis. Yeah, you see. But like in. But you know that's what they do. That's what people are afraid, because no people don't really know what's going on. That's another problem, right? Not not everybody is educated on how long each drug stays in the system, a lot of them. They get information from the Internet which is not actually very accurate, you know, like.
Yeah, I just know from experience. I was. My partner was an oil field worker who smoked cannabis.
and he stopped smoking and went up to work 2 weeks later, and an incident happened on site.
and he got kicked off site because he had
cannabis in a system, but he hadn't smoked in 2 weeks. But you can't tell through a urine test when you haven't have not smoked it's just there or it's not there where a cheek swab is a 24 h test or 48 h. Test that they can do for alcohol and for cannabis.
Yeah, yeah, no you see, and people. They really use that stuff against you if an incident happens on site.
or even like at a camp.
and there is any kind of a they, even if it happens like, let's suppose you were caught, you know, like, you know, last month, and then they it was okay. Wherever you let you pass and whatever it will, never mind they didn't give you a hard time. Later something happens and you are involved. You're going to use that stuff against you, so it's almost like
you know it's like it almost like police profiling right like. So it's like there's this kind of record that you know. You know it's just crazy and like.
and yes, Matthew. Yes, because again it's exactly what we discussed last class. I mean that this whole surveillance apparatus that I saw in there. He has to do with like, you know, productivity. That's why I said, like they wanna for them. The most important thing is to keep everything in order, because they know that by keeping everything in order I mean that it's that rhythm
that routine won't be disrupt, and that routine that we see of people coming in and off, and that is the routine of the money right like that. That's the productivity thing. So so here, people that now I mean, I haven't told you yet the most interesting stuff. Yet. Actually
so yeah, we have that we have this thing for for surveillance. I forgot how you guys call that. And you wish again this that you pass when you accounts you like. You have to swap your card. I mean you have that staff at camp, not not at the door. Well at the door. You also swap your cards. So when you came when you come in a camp
you will swap your card just like it, you know, for most doors all the doors at camps for you to open them. You need to swap your card so that controls you. So it controls your mobility, geographical mobility side of camp.
and in some like care teams, they have this thing here. I hope you can see my my my point, pointer. They have this, you know thing where you accounts, how many people are coming inside, and you also swap your card or your pack. You tack your card in there, you know.
So oh, Jen, i'll get you a second, and and then but here's the most interesting thing.
When I was in there I also paid attention that not all camps, but those more
rich camps for bigger companies there is this Swedish company called Asa a boy. Okay, i'm gonna write for you guys on the chat.
I think it's like this.
I think it is like this: you guys Google, that, and let me know if that's that's you know that's the name. So this company is a Swedish company. Yeah, Swedish Company, and they do this kind of card.
The door the door key, you know when the door keys actually a card is not a key, but a card. So they do that. And and that card is the card that opens all the doors and the monitors everything, and that company has the ability to produce reports. So that's what's for work, camp managers. That's what it's nice, because like they. So that means
so. For example, I I come to stay at camp just like a hotel. I'm given that card to open my door
and that card. I you know, like. Let's suppose that I'm. I'm. Opening and closing the door all the time.
That is suspicious. So immediately, you know, like the a report will be created at front desk or for the camp manager. Say, Marcel, I staying at this room number whatever she's opening, and calls in the door all the time. This is suspicious, highly suspicious, because
imagine, if I had to work to let's suppose that I worked 12 h that shift 12 h shift
I am. I'm supposed to be exhausted right? So i'm supposed to come. Come back to the work camp, eat something shower, and then go to bed. So next day I can do the same thing over and over again. But then, if i'm opening up, and like you're closing, opening my door, it means that I am having someone over, or it means that I might
you doing something. I mean, i'm doing something that i'm not supposed to do so, so so that company. It's the latest acknowledging car in car and key, card card key, or I don't know how you guys say, but like in it produces reports, and also
it by surveillance to convenience. Because, let's suppose I have a regular camper. I always stay at camp, which is the case for all the people I can, I can put in. I can like I can. That card is linked to a net on my cell phone.
and I can tell the app
what kind of room temperature I want. So when I swap my card automatically do like the the the air conditioning or heater, it's gonna start working, and it's gonna put in that temperature. So it builds convenience together with surveillance. Right? So it's like. So also
that app. I mean, I don't need to like for for some camps that are that, because, like as a they sell different packages. So if you are a very rich, or can you buy the full package like your employees. They don't need to check in at front desk
like they can check in at camp when they are flying. You know you're in. Admit an airport taking the flight to go to far. Mcmur. You can check in, you know, using your the app on your cell phone, and then
you just, you know you just arrive at camp, and then there's no like you. Don't go straight to your door to your dorm, to your bedroom, so you even know which bedroom the camp assigned to you. So it's it's all kind of you know. So there's i'm gonna i'm gonna actually, i'm gonna put a link for you. I'm gonna send you. I'm gonna put on a on the class on top of the class
a link to a little video, a demo of all the wonderful things that this company and discard thus for employers.
you know, if you're going to see like, it's a lot of like surveillance. So it collects data on your room temperature. You collect data on whether you are in or outside of the the the room so like they can. The the door can tell if they're in on, out, in or out, and that is very talking about profit and in economics like the housekeepers. They love that system, because I mean, they don't need to knock. They know it makes their work easier. They know that. Okay, this whole, like
I'll hear everybody's out at camp, a a, a, a Everybody's out at the mine, working at at at site, and so I can clean out everything you know. So they kind of you know it makes it easier for the housekeepers to
to know who is in without and what's going on with each room, you know so, and also can't manage they like that. So again, surveillance, you know, being a convenience is about economics. It's really kind of you know.
So we talked about the cable telephone, and then the cameras. There's cameras everywhere, because I I study surveillance. I research surveillance. I was watching.
There's pretty much no blind spot everywhere. There's a camera in camp except in the bedroom. But again the bedroom you don't really need, because you have the you know they have the plastic bag. You have the dogs you have. You have other things. You have to control the dark control. Right? So let me just see here what
okay you guys are talking about how long it stays. Right? I'll let you guys talk about it. Yeah. So yeah. So anyways, comments or questions, Greer, is there? What did you know about this card or no.
So why do you know about that?
I'd heard of it? Yeah.
yeah, and not all camps have that? Just so, you know some the camps that are kind of more, the camps that are managed by some core, and and on shell like that they have more. Most people staying their direct employees on the oil companies. They buy that technology for camps that are kind of more. It's like it's for contract workers for indirect employees.
They don't really buy that because it costs money, right like that technology. So
you know, did you know about the Internet surveillance
that goes on in there with Dallas.
Yeah, it's huge. So I don't. I don't think a lot of the workers do
again. I mean, do we need surveillance in that environment? I think so you know some people call me conservative for saying that.
but I think we need, especially with my, because I I told you guys I used to work. Not only I. I worked in the in in the automotive sector. I worked in the mining sector. I worked in the steel sector, so I used to work for factories like for for companies that have factories.
So I mean workplace, I mean, if you know, you have to control that environment, especially because it's very harsh. It's very difficult for you to stay. It. Can people do go crazy? So you know you have to kind of control You need to make sure that people are not working drunk or or or high on drugs. This is for safety reasons, and also for the chief reasons, because I mean it's it, you know. I mean, after all, it's money right? So. But what I don't like, and I don't approve of all that for me was a problem is that
they the like, the workers, they don't really they are not told.
and they could be told. I mean, I I think you know, I mean. you know, if I am to have a business, I would tell people. Look, this is those are the rules you need to have them clear laid out very clear for people, right? So
you know.
But I also understand the companies. They don't do that, because, for example, you can't really, as an employer in Canada, you cannot say. Look.
I'm going to be monitoring your Unionization movement. I'm going to be Mommy, this is this is illegal. In this country You have people have their right to unionize in this country right like. So so they also do stuff that can be illegal right like. So so it's. Please go on someone trying to talk.
Okay, people.
So I think I told you all of that, you know. Let me see. So yeah. So what is I setting here, finding scare geivers from best people, housekeepers, dishwasher, Barton, and you know, security people. There's also security on site
paramedics. They're all surveillance agents, and they really work as some some occupations like security personnel security guards. They are all more obvious, but, like I I coming into there, I didn't know that housekeepers. I didn't I? Didn't I? My jaw dropped when I was like. Oh, my gosh! Look at what they're doing right like.
So
So another thing is that surveillance people. What I I know I also noticed with this research is that back in the days, as I told you, last class surveillance used to be an occupation. You would you? You would hire people to do surveillance on others.
so I would hire someone. Greer, you know, Matthew, you know, Jen, i' to hire you people right? Okay. Your jobs to the surveillance. Not all like our capitalist system. Our economy moved away from that. We don't really have. I mean, Of course we do still have security guards.
but but, like you know, but, like you know, it's most of the surveillance, the bulk of it. It's being done, you know, like it's either by technology or like a high technology, or it's kind of embedded
in the occupation. So it's like you are a housekeeper. But you were trained that you have to watch the the garbage. You are, you know you are a bartender, but you are requested to check on people and report them. Oh, by the way, that door key! It controls your access to the bar. So if you're going every day and there again, you know, a report will be made on you myself is going too much the bar, so I have the bartender
telling only the telling about me reporting me, and I also have the technology reporting me. So you have to be careful, right? Like so.
And also people surveillance there. The surveillance that I saw it targets the body. So people literally your body, because you know, it controls your movement inside of the work camp, and also your mind. Because I mean it. It's looking at Internet, and what kind of searches you are making, and all that kind of stuff, right? So it's like. So you limit it. It makes it people very, very limited up to just to resist.
especially because in most cases don't even know what's going on. So you know, it's hard to resist that kind of surveillance
in Brazil. You'll leave the key card in a holder. That's true. That's yeah for most of hotels in Brazil You come with your card and you put your card in that little.
There is a little thing where you some hold those in Canada. They also require that it's just old. That's all technology. You put your card inside. So he activates the whole. You don't power for the entire bedroom, which is like stupid. Right now. We have much better technology that we can control everything right now. And I also forgot to say one thing, Matthew, you're gonna appreciate this.
that as a boy, that kind of key card also helps with like when you when i'm not in there
it turns off the air conditioning or the heater saving a lot of money for the work for them, for the work camps a lot of the work camps now they're calling themselves green, even because they're able to save so much energy, because in the Us. So you see, surveillance being compounded with, like, you know.
like clean clean energy, or or or or clean, and not not clean energy, but clean environment, you know, like or an environment that saves resources, you know. So it's really interesting. Another thing here.
The people who are actually doing the surveillance, the surveillance agents. They are unclear
on the work that they are doing or in and on what that surveillance work that they're they don't realize that they are doing surveillance work, and they and if they don't realize they don't think about the impact of that on people's lives right? So they just do it. It kind of it's sort of automatic, which, in my opinion, is also problematic.
So surveillance people, you regulate employees when they are off duty. Why, what do I mean? Again, it's a you avoiding certain drugs in your free time in your time. Off also that key, the the the key card. If they have the package.
That key tracks you even when you are out. So if you put like, because that key is supposed to stay with you, don't return that for as long as you are an employee there, or you stay in there, you keep the key, and also you have. Yet I assume that by now, because I did this research install, and I collect the day in 2,01516, and then in 1718, I revised all the data from for publication.
but I suspect that by now, like it doesn't even have a card anymore. It might be just your phone like you tap your phone, I I imagine, because I saw some like I didn't see that in the oil sense. But I saw in their corps company website that they were moving towards
contact. Less stuff, you know. So. But anyways, the point is that as a boy, the key.
if you put your key in your pocket, let's suppose. Okay, i'm done.
Now. I'm gonna go back to BC. Or you know us or Newfoundland. I'm gonna go back.
And but I bring the queue with me, and I have the app on my cell phone so that that stops tracking, you, you know, like, and so it tells like you know it. It allows for the employers to see exactly where you are going, and if again, if there is an incident again.
nobody's gonna check on you unless there is a reason. But if there is a reason, if you get involved in a means event, people are gonna check what you did, you know like that's that day before you actually come to work. When you're off
they're gonna see what kind of places you go to when you're off and that can become evidence against you. I don't know if this is clear what I'm trying to say here.
Yeah, yeah, Probably there he is, I mean. And again, people when when I always keep this in mind whenever there is. Whenever there is surveillance there is resistance.
But you know what I saw in there. I'm sure people find their ways to, you know, to camouflage to, you know. But but it's but it's hard to find your way to come a fly something when you don't know that you're being tagged right like, and that's what you know.
So surveillance people, it gets really creepy. Okay? Because oh, sorry people surveillance gets really really creepy, you know.
like you know, they use that power against each other like, you know, workers, they they just once they realize that because people who stay longer in in camps. They kind of learn a little bit about the surveillance that's going on, and they can use that against others so they can kind of, you know. Oh, I don't want to, you know I don't want to be seen here. I want to avoid going to the bar, or they say, oh, you know, someone goes to the bar too much, you know. You can check their cards. I mean, they They kind of you know that. You know people.
humans whenever there is conflict, and one person wants to take the other person down, they use whatever they they have, and and quite often, you know, they rely on that surveillance apparatus. You know the the the little bit that they know about it.
and then people
are those who are more conscious about what's going on? You can't. It's precise, and the people we stay longer in. There. They they surveillance for them is a huge source of stress, especially if, like they are struggling with like alcohol. Use and abuse, or drug use and abuse. If they're struggling. If something, or if they are a Union leader, or I mean, it becomes a huge problem, because, you know, like they, they know that I mean
that anything, anything and everything can be used against them
right? So. So, anyway. So in terms of like what what was nice about this article, and also this research that I do with Sarah, there
is that Sarah? I don't know for those of you who know her, I mean. Perhaps you took some courses with Sarah, or she was very interested in explain workforce, mobility like life, you know, like you are not from here. You're not from there. You are in between the impact of that on family and everything.
But it was what was nice that, like by the participating in her research and kind of my contribution to her research was that I mean a big, a big part to Big Chunk of life on the move is surveillance, and the literature
that talks about for Mcmurray, and also other places, because, like we in Newfoundland, we also have that kind of arrangement because we have the oil platforms in Newfoundland, and we have people doing flying fly out into the oil platforms out at sea.
So you know, here in Alberta, and also in Newfoundland, and also a little bit in northern BC. And northern Saskatchewan, there's a lot of like all of stuff happening in gas happening so like. So, anyways like window Canada, a lot of the economy in this country has to do with like mobility, workforce mobility, not only the immigrants, people like myself, coming from outside, but also Canadians born in Canada, who kind of migrate
like on a temporarily a temporarily basis for work and surveillance is a huge part of that, you know. It really dictates your life at work, and also your life outside of work. So that was the biggest contribution of this paper to show that, you know, because until this paper
people who study mobility and workforce mobility, job mobility, they were not to kind of attuned or like. They were not thinking about surveillance, you know. So so, anyways, I hope
that with this I kind of got you guys excited to kind of perhaps even do research about surveillance, because it is truly everywhere, and it really changes our lives everywhere. It's just like, you know.
We don't realize. So another thing that I want to share with you is that with this research, like what we could see is that you know, the the big contribution is that surveillance.
you know, enables different types of work arrangements. I mean that that surveillance you keeping everybody in order, you know you it allows for you to pay controls. It controls. Those are different arrangements. For example, I'll give you a pure example.
You can see how many people you have at camp. So because of that car key you can plan ahead like if you are the cap manager. You know how many people you're gonna need. You know how many people are coming. You can work around. You can see how many bedrooms that you can. You can. That survey allows you to organize like life in the ground, you know, like life, you know the actual daily life inside of camp.
and also allows for you to plan. You know, for airplanes how many airplanes you need to charge to bring. You know it controls everything right. So
if people are late, you you can track where they are. You know you. You decide if you're gonna wait for them, or if the airplane is not gonna fly, I mean, so you you can make a lot of decisions, because you have the information that's been gathered by surveillance. I'm not excited about that. But that's what happens, You know, on the ground
it really kind of surveillance really produces meaning for people, because you, you know, you change their identity, change like you know how they want to be seen. People act differently when they know that they are under surveillance. So if I know, I know that I you know I do drugs, for example, i'm not gonna do those drugs in there that's gonna change, you know. Or perhaps
because I have, I actually drug use and abuse disorder. I I won't. I won't be able to help myself, and because of my addiction I will go ahead and have it. So that was that can get me in tribal. So it's like, you know. We really change like you know, it produces meaning for people right like
like surveillance people in there. I didn't cover this much, but I notice that again. I I noticed that, like there, like in the conversation with camp managers, and also like the housekeepers, even though they a lot of the housekeepers themselves, not all of them, but a lot of them are people, of course.
color like myself, like brown black, you know. So they, even though they are people of color themselves. They tend to target people of color.
you know, like they tend to be more kind of. Oh, there is a brown person here. There is like. They tend to be more. You know they tend to be like they profile, you know they make profile so like. So if you are, you know a person of call, or most likely they're gonna go through your garbage in more detail.
And if you are a white person they're gonna go like, you know again. I saw this because I was following there. I was following their like routine for for 2 weeks, and and and I could tell the names because they have the names of each like, you know they have a they work with like a little.
They have a little thing like a a file where they can see room numbers, and they who lives in there, you know, in that room, number and I I could. I was forming them so I could see that stuff, and I could tell the n by the name right? So when I see some names that I mean, you know, like I know that are Those names are not English, white English they are, you know they are some names you cannot tell, but most names you can tell, especially if you if you're exposed to like me. I lived in in Asia. I've lived in, you know, several countries like 6 countries. I can.
I can tell names right, and I I teach a lot of students. I know a lot of people so I can tell names. So so they were, you know, so I could see another thing. There is
a class on going into that, you, because managers like they tend to stay. If you are, let's suppose of a a manager in some core or shell, or cnrl, or if you are a big executive, a directory, you come to do a tour and stay at camp.
You get a different kind of room. You can even bring alcohol to your room. So it's like, so the controls sort of balance, if it if it's, it varies according to your occupation, you know, I mean who who you are right like, so that that is very.
I also had the chance to see, like the bedrooms, where, like the dorms, were like High End people stay, and you know. And again I learned all all of that from talking to the following to work and talking to the to the people on the ground.
Another thing is gender, as I told you again, it's very heterosexual. The norm in there. People forget that we have Lgbtq. 2 plus people everywhere. Right? So it's like. So, anyways, they are looking for the wrong kind of hair or whatever.
Another problem is that you know I mean Well, another like surveillance can help you trace movements. I mean, this is kind of we cover that.
you know. Sir Venice can promote team work.
but also can you know a role team work again? You know we can like, Allow we can. You know you can close your eyes for things that are that you want them to. You know you don't mind if people are work very hard, and they are part of a group.
You know you close your eyes, and you pretend that you didn't see. You know that you're in task coming back positive whatever. But if it's people that you don't like you use them against right. So that's why I have this little little marking here. So you guys remember that I can go both ways and also surveillance people links.
But that should
productive life to
reproductive life. In sociology.
also in criminology and social science and psychology, quite often, like the life. The work life is called
production of life
and your like home. Your private life is is called reproductive life, because that's when you kind of replace, replenish yourself, you rebuild yourself, you get ready to work again. So anyways doesn't matter how you're going to call. But what's the importance that surveillance links work life to
personal life because it's it's a link. It brings those 2 things together because tags you, even when you are not in there right like, or it controls your behavior again. I I stop drinking because I know that tomorrow I have to go back to work right. So so, anyway. So
what I learned is that core core element in work, life and the oil science right like.
And let's see what Valencia says. Here it's funny. How's it going to make sure we never find out the true identity of someone because we are always pretending. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're we're always pretending something right like it. And that's the thing. Oh, actually the following. And this deserves an article, you know, on your side
I mean People Haven't said that yet I mean people have said, but like not like not a full article dedicated to that idea. The idea that surveillance kind of makes you almost like you. You have a mask.
You keep that mask on all the time, because you know that you know you are under surveillance all the time, so it's almost like you know. It forces you right that into a specific kind of like the identity that is not necessarily your identity. This is sort of kind of what we discussed in the classification part of this course. But again, but you know, and perhaps you should write about it, you know. Write something about it, and get published, because this is a nice idea.
Let's see what our
so look, what can we do with this information? I think that we could pressurize employee employers, you know to kind of choose more kind of wise metrics, you know. Be more transparent with people
instead of kind of like doing those very, very intrusive surveillance they could create a system of, you know carrots and sticks like you know. Kind of, you know you kind of, instead of kind of
being all over your face, you could create something else and
make people comply. We felt actually having to, you know, be so intrusive in your lives, right like
you also have to accept. If you're an employer that isn't the best workers, you know, they will do something wrong, because again, we are humans, and we can't keep it straight all the time. A 100%,
you know, we're gonna do something that could be just like it goes back to that idea that I mean oh, I have nothing to lose there, for I am gonna I don't care. No, you know, something can become a problem always right, like
also like surveillance in work camp
that I mean. Again, if the housekeepers knew what they were up to, if they were more conscious about their work, and like they would be. Perhaps if they were trained as surveillance agents, they would. They would not discriminate against the people.
They would. They would take the same amount of time to to go through every garbage. You guys know what I mean like, but because they don't they they let their bias playing in, you know. So if we? There was some sort of training. Perhaps the block the bias would be.
you know, and be like more controlled, more well managed.
And also they could, you know some, some some monitoring that goes on in there like you know they are monitoring you. We even when you're not in there. I mean, that's unnecessary. I see this as a potential violation actually, now that with the new
privacy laws that I would discuss earlier in the course. Not that that's actually legal. Now, you know.
so like to, you know. You only can collect the information that is absolutely necessary. You can. You can't just go above and beyond right like.
So people that's it from this part. Let me see, you guys Here, let me see if you have questions or comments, or anything.
because i'm going to start the next article. I know I have 10 min, but i'd like to use them
people. Is this interesting? Did you guys like it? There's a lot of stuff to study in for my Kamarian surveillance. You know a lot. This is just like the deep tip again. This research was not it wasn't even like
I study on surveillance, I mean. I only captured whatever had to do with life on the move.
because again, when we do ethics, you cannot go above you have to. Only if you you say, oh, i'm going to do a research on that. You only can capture that. You can't all to me here? No, you know. So I was very constrained in the information that I could ask and gather up to in order to follow my ethics protocols.
But I if it's just, I I believe that I will end up moving to the United States. But if I am to stay here in Canada, if I was to stay here in Canada. Well, I don't know yet in my life; but like if I if I stay in Alberta.
I would like to actually do you know, to do a study only on any employee surveillance here in the province, not only like for Mick Murray, but also, you know, employees. Certainly, in general, I would like to do that, you know, in in and understand exactly how people feel about it, and how surveillance impacts productivity positively and also negatively, so like to do more. And this is for you guys. You are the future you're gonna stay here. I mean, are you gonna You're gonna. You're just beginning your life
right? So there's a lot to be to be done in this field of surveillance work, you know.
And then see, this is I also I I I to kind of show you guys, because I I I I was like oh, my gosh! This is so interesting! I found it very interesting when I was doing, especially when I I still remember that tales guy showing me, you know, like like the log of someone's Internet I was like man. This is just like mind blowing.
So so it's a leakage of collecting for
No, no, no, Valencia. Yeah. Yeah, Valencia, it is the policy sounds like this.
You can only collect information on people that are strictly strictly necessary for the business.
But what happens? Violence is that people they take advantage of, as I told you, in my class, lack of enforcement.
Now things will change with the new policy, with the new legislation. Pro Hopefully, we're going to have better enforce like more people audit and more people checking. You know what employers are doing, but because employers, especially those big companies, they know that nobody is going to check on them. They do whatever they want, you know that's the reality of the ground.
That's You'll be your sense. Do you plan to follow up your search, perhaps in a few years. Yeah, you know I again, I if I stay in Alberta career, if I stay here.
because right now I am a full stock, so my status is i'm doing. I'm a pop post off on the research. I'm teaching very, very little in the in my in my contract, even though I am in in in Edmonton.
I actually work in Newfoundland right in the I mean more of a diversity.
and I will. I am on the job market now. So hopefully, i'm gonna find a professorship meaning I mean, i'm not gonna be a postalk anymore. I like I'm gonna become a professor, a professor in some university. So if I stay in Alberta
there is a chance on, you know. There's a chance that maybe something, Calgary. But if I stay in Alberta as I will follow up. If I don't stay in Alberta, then No, I will not follow up there, you know anyways
so surveillance in schools. Yeah, I need a surveillance in the schools. I mean, this is huge, especially after the pandemic. It became huge. You can what the fees is like, you know, master, thesis on how students feel about it, how that impact their their performance, You know you could make a an intervention study to see how people test under surveillance, and and we thought in surveillance definitely.
I would go for that. That would be like, You know
what phase of your personal life. We believe you'll be exploited next You' I didn't get your question, Jessica. What phase of your personal of the personal?
I believe you
more just like because you said in the work camps, like everything like every part of their their lives, were Basically, tracked.
Did they have like anything private that eventually might get tracked eventually, like even like back in habits, or
like sleep schedules, or like any like little thing like
in that regard.
Well, they they do try. Yeah. Good question. They what I know. I didn't put that in the paper, by the way. But very good question of yours. But what I know is that that for the camps that have that key
they track sleep patterns because, like the th, the that that he knows when you turn on and turn off the lights. Obviously, maybe you can go to bed and and you turn on. You turn off the lights, but you don't sleep right. Maybe stay on your your phone and everything but like. But let's suppose that you are that kind of person that you you know You lay down and you turn off these lines, and then you put your cell phone away so they can. They can track that. I mean, they don't, I I I I did not hear of them producing
reports on that, but they could, because you look, they could cross the information coming from. Tell us your Internet usage.
because I mean for a slipping. You're not using the Internet right like it's kind of they can track that telescope to know when we are active when we are not active on the Internet, and they could. They could cross that variable with that variable from the key. If your line is on or off
so they could. They could sort of get a very good estimate of your sleep at sleeping patterns, you know they could get they They would not be perfect, because again. You can be light off, you know. Your tell cell phone is away, but you're not actually sleeping. You're just trying to sleep.
You get the point, but you know that is one thing, Another thing that I noticed. I I actually like your comment.
Something that I notice staying at work camps is that every room.
Every room has a calendar like like this, you know. Every room has a calendar.
and people they count days just like if, as if they were literally in prison, so they count days. So they and they don't usually have the rituals when you. When you get to the you know half of your state. You you do something, you know you go out to town, and you have a beer of people, all that town, or it's your pharmac maritime, or you do something right like they call hunt. They like hump day in English. That's how they call it.
but anyways. But the point is that I mean the calendar itself.
It's not a it's not a surveillance tool. It does not collect data on you or anything. The calendar.
however, they interject that calendar, and that
guides their behavior and guides their discipline. So here it's not really a surveillance thing, but it's a feature in the landscape that guides their behavior in a very intimate level. Right doesn't mean you guys your emotions how you feel about it, if you are excited, or all, or you like depressed. Oh, My gosh! I still have like more, you know, 10 days to go, you know, like so you know. But but but yeah, so off the top of my head. That's the sleeping pattern
they could get to that.
and I I again. I would need to do more research to understand better, because again I just like I told you was very limited.
So a better way of saying it would be officially legal. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah, Thank you very much. Brier: yeah, I hope. Yeah, anyways. But but, by the way, people regardless, I I tell that to all my students, regardless of where I am and what I am doing.
Once you guys take a take a classroom with me. I You are my team and I. We team up. I don't know if you guys understand what I mean by that, like you know, whatever it doesn't matter where I am, you know, like
you know, my you of the emails perpetual. I always have it. I always we have it hopefully, I mean, you know, unless you, if it kicks me out. But I mean it's always easy to find people on the Internet. So you can find me. And if you ever need anything from me, a reference letter, help me for application for my school dentistry. You know, Med Med school, whatever I
people, I do a lot of that work for my students because I for me, like you guys, your success is truly my success when I like this. Last week I got a I, a student of mine, who took a course with me at a U. Of a couple of years ago. Actually, and I I helped her to apply for
for law school she got in. So she texted me. She was so happy, Marcel I got in and like, Thank you. And I was like oh, my gosh! That was almost like me getting into law school, you know, and another student also like like this past few days. I was actually in the Us. And I got text message from her. Another one she took a 2 years ago with me at the U. Of this other person, and she got into a master's degree in health, Sciences
health policy at Ucla, in the United States. I was delighted. And actually she got to 2 universes. One is Ucla, where she's gonna take the offer and and another one. So anyways, if you guys ever need anything for me. That's how I see we are a team, and my success
is your success, and vice versa. You know the more resources I have the better for me to help you guys, and whatever you guys need for me never hesitate because I for me, teaching is not like teaching teaching for me is like mobilizing knowledge is like, you know, getting people inspired is getting people to achieve their dreams. Okay.
So you guys count on me always. So that's it. People Won't start the next one. But it's okay. I we have time to adjust, so i'm not too concerned. You guys go take care of yourselves.
Watch your mental health and physical health, and you know self surveillance on your health and take care. Okay, people, Thank you so much.
Thank you. People Thank you. Everybody take care.
Thank you for your comments. You guys have a wonderful weekend.
Thank you so much, people.
I'm going to turn off your people.
Hi! Oh, okay, let me just stop and just stop the recording. Then hold on a second.
Just see how I do that. Hold on a second.
"

Mar 14

"Hey, folks! Hello, everybody! Welcome aboard. So let me see. Someone has questions about the his. Say.
Let me just read the question here.
No, you're the you are, Joey, you are. If they didn't evade in surveillance like you know, in general, so you should not be able, you know, in you. But I should like, you know people should not be able to track you down. So that's the idea.
So it's like you are.
It's not like No, it's not a particular person, but just like in general. Okay. you just see what else you said.
Yeah, you could. You could come up with a fake, Id idea. But just make sure that you're gonna explain how you're gonna get it, because incredibly
getting fake documents is like that. Actually work that it's actually kind of like
good. Lucky enough, genuine enough. It's not easy. So
yeah, that would be allowed. Okay.
let me see if you have more questions or any body people.
Yeah, that's no. We're gonna go more high tech stuff like it, like the whole thing when you do your like. Yeah, no, we're not gonna account otherwise it would be possible to live in society right like it's more like a keep in mind. It's more like a an assignment about a plan like to to kind of
not being traceable like for you, not for people not to be able, not being able to track you down.
track down or tracking down is a important key word in here for you to understand the assignment. So the the whole idea is you should disappear
without like leaving traces or or ways in which people could track you down. So, for example, if you disappear, but you keep using your credit card. People are going to track you down. It's easy to track it down if you know you disappear. But you know you are not in a place where you have
a lot of cameras and and potentially cameras with like artificial intelligence plugged like in China. They're gonna track you down so like. The the whole idea is a plan for you to kind of avoid being tracked down. Okay.
and and and the assignment also includes a little discussion on how you did that right? Because that's when you you it's almost like an opportunity for you to reflect back on how difficult actually actually this is. It's not easy. It's not an easy task right to disappear in today's society.
Is it? Is it clear? Do we have more questions?
It makes more sense. Okay, good. I was going to show you a video. Okay. So people welcome. Let's let's get started here. We with today's class. I was going to show you a video.
I actually prepared that video for like last class, for to show you, it's a quick video. It's that has to do with our class like the content that we're gonna discuss today.
But it has some kind of it's a crime scene. So you know, Later, it it was actually good that I was supposed to teach today's class last class, but it was good that we are running late, because then I got some time to think about it, and I i'm not gonna
share with you. I'll tell you about it, but not share the like screen with you, because it kind of it looks not. Everybody can take that. It's a crime scene. So in in, you know, in any anyways, i'll talk more about it, but like, so I the point is, i'm gonna share. I'm gonna put on the class for you. The video and i'm gonna put a warning there. So later, if you want to check it up, you can check.
But if you don't feel comfortable. You just don't check. But again, the the the video is just to illustrate the point. and it's not too bad. It's not too too bad. Well.
too too bad depends on, you know, for me, coming from Brazil and being exposed to like very like to violence all the time. Urban violence. It's not a big deal.
No, it No, Jessica, I will not show you in class. I'll just talk about it, and it's not. It's just a crime scene. So you see some blood stains. You see some people collecting a corpse or someone you don't really see. But you see the like, you know people kind of you see, the body being transported so like a rap to obviously wrapped in something. So you don't actually see the body, but like anyways. But but the point is we're going to talk about that in today's class. So it's not like a so i'm going to put the video up there. It's like it's not.
It's like it was.
It was made pop public through the newspapers to the news. But i'm gonna put a little warning there. So if you want to watch you watch. If you don't don't it doesn't really, you know, like it's just to illustrate the point, and but anyways it so we for some people for me. For example, it's okay.
because I've seen so many of those I've seen those in like in real life life. But first for people in Canada like a crime scene, and we don't get a lot of home signs in Canada right? We don't get a lot of
like police brutality even in in actually, this video has with police brutality, which is the one of the topics that we're gonna discuss today. So, anyway, so we're gonna start people and just share my screen with you. So i'm gonna start. Actually.
I'm going to start actually with.
Oh, Don't: just find my thing here.
Okay, i'm gonna share. You guys hear me? Well, right like you hear me? Well, you see me? Well, right? Okay. So i'm gonna share my screen. We're gonna start with the file. It's called policing one March 9. Okay, so that's we're gonna start with that file. So just so, you know. So you can make your notes.
So, people we're discussing, listening today, and that's why you know that's why i'm kind of you know a button about those videos. So before I start, actually I. When I was preparing for today's class, I came across an information that actually I want to share with you just for the sake of knowledge.
We talked a lot about Michelle for call in the Panopticon right like we talked a lot about that, and just display this thing here
duplicate screen. So we talked about Michel Foucault, and I don't know if I told you guys, that it's really rare actually to find a prison
that that has that design of the panoptica. Did they say that to you, folks that you it's actually very rare, even though, like the Panopticon allegedly, it's a very good kind of architecture for you to watch anybody inmates students, you know, patients, and and even like in in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in the prison. But you know, like the prison system doesn't really, you know, Apply that architecture.
So what I have for you here.
It's a slide that I got. I I use for something else. But I just I want to use this. I just to show you this prison here. It's called Stateville. It is in the United States it is in.
I can't remember if it's in Michigan. I think it's Michigan or Ohio. You guys can Google that if you oh, I it's here. Illinois. Actually, I put on this line. It is in Crest Hill, Illinois. Okay, or you know, I and
and it was. It was here in this season that's where the whole rehabilitative movement started in North America. So this idea that
reason is not to punish people, but prison is to try to rehabilitate people. That's where in North America that's kind of where this movement started, and then first in the United States, and then, you know, in Canada to and then slowly, the like we like. We actually later the movements start in the United States, but in Canada we acted on it faster. So we were like we don't have the capital punishment here anymore. We stopped hanging much before the United States. So we were like
we were like faster in Canada than in us. But anyways, why i'm talking about this. I'm showing you this because I don't know if you see this little. this little.
this little thing here like this building. It's called. There's a name for for that like around how they call this.
Oh, gee! I forget how they call. They have a nickname for this building.
but I don't know if you can tell just from looking at the building. This is actually up an optic. And so this is one of the few prisons in the world
that that actually implemented
like that panoptican model that Jeremy Bentham wrote about. And then later Foucault wrote about it. Okay, so I I I thought that you guys would like to see this, and and this is the only prison
or in Canada we don't have. We? Don't have like anything like that? We don't have that applied okay in Canada.
I don't know. Actually, maybe you know, I in Europe, probably. Matthew, I don't know check because I don't know I've heard of this prison, but I. I have never seen anything. What I've heard about it.
I know this prison because there is a scholar in Cambridge called Addison Libbling, and she does a surveying there, and I'm. I'm familiar with her survey. But I've never. I've never read anything in relations to the panacea. Maybe this.
but I know that in North America. Well, in the world it's still very, really rare to find in the North America. This was the first one. Okay, so maybe you're gonna find another one like kind of inspired in the United States, not in Canada, in the Us. Maybe there is another one.
but it is, and and because I mean, that's a that's a good question. I don't know.
And actually I love your question because there is a sub researcher. Her name is Ashley. She's based off the University of Hawaii, and she is one of the biggest names in prison history.
So if you want to read about prison history, she is the go-to, and so her name is Ashley
Ashley. Oh, Google, do her book, and then you're gonna find her last name it's like her. Late one of her books is called the Deviant Reason.
I put it here in the chat. So you're gonna find her. It's. Actually, I can't remember her last name right over Robin. No.
I think it's Robin, not not very sure. I can't remember, because I I Anyways, I know her book, I her. I know her material. I know her, but I can't remember the name. But but so if you are interested in prison history, go to her much your warm. Why, i'm talking about her. Yeah, that's it. So Ruben: yeah, that's it. That's exactly that. So she I asked her. I was like
I was like I actually met her in July last year in a conference in Portugal, and I told her, Ashley, you are the greatest name in in history in prison history.
you know, and we read all this like focalian like inspired by focal. And you know, if a coin prison, and you know and I, I don't really see this like you know, this architecture style being applied with very few exceptions, and like, you know and like, why is that
she was like, yeah, Marcella, you know, this is a good question, and I also don't know. But what I know is that I mean it's. It perhaps is not very effective, because you know, like the the like. You still like. It's too many people if you conceptually. That's what she told me. I'm sharing with you conceptually.
If you think about like the actual design. Think about this prison that you have here in your in your picture, I mean.
look at how many sales you're gonna have like, right like in one building.
So it's it's it's very risky to have that many people, all kind of face each other, because they can communicate right like you mean if if we are in this kind of building, I can communicate with the person on the other side. I can see that person I can communicate unless I I, I I put a door before we do, which is not really the case, except for for solitary or intensive housing, as we say in criminology.
but we, we, you know, like so you may stick, actually move inside of it like that kind of building. It's not very effective in terms of like, allows for a lot of communication interaction between the inmates, the residents. It makes like the the movement more kind of risky, because.
like, for example, if you're going to move. Let's suppose it's er time now. It's the art time for a bunch of inmates, and then you get them, and then you're going to move them around, and you're going to pass across many, many units, many cells, and then they're going to
get get them down so they can see they are, I mean. So that movement people don't know it's maybe because you guys don't I mean you don't. You don't have any dealings with prison, so you don't really know, but like the movement inside of prison, like when you're moving inmates to the yard, back and forth.
It's very, very risky, because that's when enemies they see each other, and that's when they fight they break out. So it's. Think of a high schools like the same. It's almost like actually a lot of the prisons in Canada. They look like high schools. So when you know that moment where the bell goes off like everybody's out, and and that's when people be each other. That's where the travel happens. The same thing is in prison. So when you are moving mates around, you know they see the people who hold them money, or the people, you know, like people who they don't like
I can. That's when you know things start. So when you think about this architecture, Matthew. See if you if you guys I mean all of you guys, Joey and everybody else. See if you guys kind of picture what i'm trying to say here. It's an architecture that it can be very effective for surveillance.
but it's not very effective for the the way that prison is organized. and any anyways, I had this conversation with I actually, and she was like, yeah, we're selling, you know. So
so so you know. So that that's what I mean, I know. And then she pointed me to some archives for me to do research on it. So let's see Matthew here. So is is that? What is that? How rotary reasons came about? Yes, exactly
exactly. Because again you you know it's. Yeah.
So we think of prisons as sales and people, but it's more complex than that, right? So
so, anyway, so some people, this was just like just to get you guys warmed up. So today we're gonna talk about this very famous book.
Obviously you're not gonna read the whole book I am giving you just like an article which is a summary of the book.
and this book is called on the Run. Okay. Wanted Men in Flood in a Philadelphia.
And so one of the videos, Jessica and everybody else. One of one of the videos that I was going to show you it was a Get all in Philadelphia. I'll I'll put that on the class for you. But again, what that video for for the fuel They don't get it all. There is no crime. Scene: it's kind of it's heavy
because you're gonna see, you know people suffering, but it's not like it's not like crime. Scene: okay. So because I I wanted you guys to have a look at what I get all in North America. Looks like in Canada. We don't really have that. We do have some scholars in Canada, including some scholars at the U. Of a
that they did their research in in Toronto. But I I have to tell you something. Me coming from Brazil.
and also someone I've been in a lot of like Third World countries like South Africa, You know, countries like Mexico, countries where criminality is very, very like strong. I mean, we have very high rates for criminality. I mean, I would tell you that I mean in Canada. What do we have? Kind of very low income neighborhood that actually becomes a kind of because I mean, you know, like
It's just the people who live in those neighborhoods who actually going there, and for people who don't believe in those neighborhoods. They have nothing to do with those neighborhoods. So we do have a few of them like I would say that in Vancouver we do have some areas that are more sketchy, and they are very, very low income that neighborhood also, and they are somewhat dangerous. I mean, in terms of because You're going to see a lot of people very high on drugs, and you know. And then, when you're high on drugs, you do things that you don't want to do, and all those things.
So you know. So you're gonna see them in in in Vancouver. You see them in Toronto, but they are nothing compared to what we see in the developing world. And again, the video that I was going to share you just like church. I I i'll. I'll put it on, on on the class.
It's a crimes it's like it's a favela in Brazil. I don't know. Have you ever heard of this name? People Favela? Have you ever heard of that
that name on each? On on the chat? Matthew says he has Jo. Yes, anybody else. People. Did. You guys hear of their name Favela. It means like shunty towns. Okay, it's like it's a Ghetto. Pretty much is a Ghetto. Okay? So I was going to show you like a comparative kind of view of a Gearo in North America and a Giro, a Ghetto in Brazil, and even, like the worst Ghetto in the United States, like in Philadelphia or Chicago or yeah. So, Selena, it's. That's how you pronounce it. It's a Portuguese word, but now it's it's increasingly in criminology people use that in English like, you know, you just use the word. So that means Shanty Town.
Okay, Shunti.
you know, or like you know, or slam or slams, or, you know, like they're like all their like slings for for this. But anyway, so like this is like a so in in in Brazil.
Mexico, as I all the developing all over the developing world. You get a lot of that, and we are talking about like a like a place where, because they get us here in North America. Think of the worst place that you've been or you heard about it. There is always see which, you know there is always like tap water.
You know there is always some sort of electricity going on
in in the developing world. When you look at a Ghetto
you don't really see there is no sewage. The sea, which is open like it's open sewage like you see the water running, you know, down like the the road which is not paved. It's just like a dirt road, and and you there's like no top water. People have to kind of, you know. They have to go and fetch a fetch their water from somewhere, you know.
So, like the electricity is really illegal, they still let's recently from the greed. It's not actually, by the way, it's not the actual people, we still the electricity from the grade. It is like those gangs who are taking care of the
or not, or care as well, but like who dominate those areas, they still, and they redistribute that energy, that electricity illegally also in terms of TV cable TV. They also, like those gangs gang leaders, like in many many countries, drug cartels.
they still the electricity from the to the They still like signal from cable TV, and they sell it in some areas. They even have their own TV where they kind of. They still like the the cartels or the gangs. They, you know they they they not. You should be TV now. They have Youtube channels
that they they provide like they still the signal from live TV, and they put out there through a Youtube channel, so people can see it, you know, can watch, and they obviously they charge the population for that. They also play security gangs and cartel. I mean, you've seen this in movies, so they play security, and they charge people for, you know, like a security kind of fee on a monthly basis. If you have a business.
they charge you to run that business as well like, you know, so they charge a like a a a fee every a monthly fee, and if you don't pay that, I mean, like, very likely they can take your life, or they can do some harm to you.
or they can order you to shut down your business right? So so that how it works so. But anyway, so this book here is about Alice's. Oh.
Alice is experienced like living in a Ghetto in Philadelphia. Okay. But again, it is like, I'm: not a developed
high income Country kind of Gil is nothing like what I've seen Brazil or Mex or South Africa. Okay.
So here, people.
let me just say something about this girl I don't know. Have ever heard of his name Alice Goffman.
Anybody here? No, probably not so her father. His name was yeah. You've okay, great. Okay. So me see. And I've heard of her and and Matthew of his father, probably Irving
Irving Goffman
lost her father.
Her father People is a brilliant criminologist. He passed already his dad not here anymore. And he actually he is from Alberta.
Okay, he's a Canadian from a word. And very few people know that
I think, on campus on on the UV campus. We do have a statue of of him like you know we statue is somewhere in there. I think I've seen it like a close to. You know the bus stop over there. Close to the is a dentistry, I think, somewhere in there.
and
and he's brilliant. He went to. I think he finished his academic life in Chicago at Chicago University. He's one of the greatest canon of criminology, so she's the daughter of this guy. So when she published a book people were like, oh, there was this whole thing, because I mean she is, you know, she picking up Professor, too, and and she's very young, by the way, and and obviously the name helped a lot her because she has this
super kind of prestigious name tied to her first name. And but so. But her book got a lot of like this book on the run. Got a lot of like some people of it, and some people hate it. Okay, some people said, this is excellent. Some people said, this is horrible. Okay.
Yeah, exactly. So she got, you know, like, yeah. So she was the problem that it's not that I mean she. She had the clearance from the university and everything. So she had, like the ethics approval for her to do her search. But the thing is that in a lot of the time she start kind of baiting
some some of the people that she was also interviewing because she she's staying in that place, that Ghetto in Philadelphia became kind of her home.
So the problem may see, was that in research you should as much as possible to separate you, your personal life and your private life, right like. And because she she did what she did was ethnographic research.
So that means that she had to kind of live the life of those folks, and and and she kind of lost a little bit the boundary, you know, like you still can. Do you know, ethnographic like research, but like
in the beginning of ethnography, like in the early nineteenth century, a late nineteenth century, and in the early twentieth century. What she did, what? Which was this full immersion in people's life was okay. But in today's world
like rules around science, change it, and and you can't really immerse in the way that she did to the point. You're going to be dating people, you know, genuinely. I mean. It seems that she was genuine about her dating and stuff. But you can't, you know. I mean
you can't really be so kind of, you know, like. So she lost a little bit about the boundary, and I personally.
I don't find her like as like
it's. I think it's fair to fair, honest, academic work. I think it'd be again with some caveats. But I don't find her brilliant. Okay, but some people but it people go. They either hate her or they just
love her. Okay. So anyways.
so people, this is her okay. She's super young, and that helps the fact that she's golfman's daughter. He he helped her a lot with like her academic life. He opened a lot of doors.
regardless if she's good or bad, but like that that always helps right. It's about now works so right now she's. She's a professor at universal Wisconsin in the United States so kind of close to Alberta here down well, not so close, but like you know, in the Us. Northern part of of us Wisconsin.
and and this piece that we're going to read is in the American socio-lodge.
which is a very
big big journal in sociology. Okay, so people. So what she did, let me tell you what she did here. So she was in Philadelphia. I believe that she was. She moved in there for a school
for her undergrad degree, and that's when she kind of start to get involved in this kind of research even before she finished her undergrad. And so she was like doing this field work for about 6 years.
and the whole field work that she did was about like young males. Usually people call her mostly black folks, and and she was trying to understand recidivism. Okay, so like she was trying to understand, like like
like this idea that people get trapped like in real fending. Okay, so like you commit a crime. And then you go to jail and then you get released, and then you know you break your
your your, your our role rules. If you don't know those terms that i'm talking about per role or probation. Whatever you tell me you're gonna explain to you. So you go to to prison, and then you break your parole. Let's say the rules that you know that allows you to be on, on, on, on, like a release from jail. And then you know you're not supposed to drink, and then you drink, and then you know, and then you get, and then you get, like you know, sent back to J again. So you get trapped right in that cycle. So she wanted to understand that.
and for her to understand that what she did was this like full life immersion in a Ghetto, and what she and and here's some points for you.
So she was very concerned with policing.
So for her policing. The way that policing happens was the main problem into tracking
people into the cycle of recidivism. Recidivism and criminology means re offending. So we have this word. Okay, recidivism. So it's like a real fending so in why police would be the problem? Because, according to her findings, from her experiencing experience, living with those folks in the Ghetto like it's almost like police officers. They were always on the hunt.
so it's like they were like stopping people, you know, like padding people down without any kind of like, you know obvious need for so it's just like the fact. Oh, I've seen you before. I know that you are present day. You've been in prison. I know that you are an excon. I'm gonna am gonna, you know. I'm gonna i'm gonna search you and I I I don't have a warrant. But i'm, gonna do it, You know i'm gonna If if I see you purchase something like your let's suppose you are at a bar, you know drinking.
I'm gonna go check on you, even though I don't have any like. You know I don't have any
like evidence that I mean that you are someone who should not be drinking, but, like you know, like about all, just go, because for sure, here in this gate or there's so many people who are ex cons and or and people who are released either on parole or probation, that you know the likelihood that if someone's drinking the likelihood that that person, anyway, someone's doing anything
that that population is over represented. I mean, there's a lot of people who are under rules like correctional rules. So, and then I see someone, and then, like I, I go proactively. I go search as a police officer, so that's what she saw, and then like, and then I I catch you drinking your break. I check. I look. I look you up in the system, and then I go. Okay, You know
I I look you up and I see. Okay, you have. You know you're not supposed to be drinking. Okay, here's a fine. Here's a ticket, or you know, here's an infraction. I'm gonna arrest you and send you back to jail. So
let me tell you, are you guys following? It's very simple. The whole idea. It's not. There's nothing it's about police visibility people. It's about being visible to the it's about policing and visibility. It's about you living in a neighborhood that is visible for having a lot of people who are
who have a history with law enforcement, and then you kind of search in there. So it's almost like if I go search money if I go search for fruits. Okay, I'm gonna give you a stupid example here. If I go search for fruits
in this traffic on a old straw on a farmer's market, I will find fruits.
but if I both search for fruits
in West, I mean the more i'm I probably Won't Find that many right. So if i'm going to go search for you know.
you know, for for clothing in West into the Mall, I will find a lot if i'm gonna go search for clothing and outfits in this traffic on a market. I'll you I will not find any, so it's like it essentially boils down to that. I mean, you know you know that in that area the likelihood you're gonna find, You know
it's higher than you search in there and then you find, and then, like the question that she raises in the book which is not really in the article. But I would like to share this with you is like. Is this really worth it?
You know we just have so many, so much police resources. We don't have what we, you know when we think about listening
are, in fact, limited. I don't know if you ever try to call cop, and in many cases with the police I mean I I've less time last year, like 2 years ago, I had something on my building, and I had to call the police, and it took for like it was, it took forever
for the police to appear, and by the time that the police appeared
like we, the the residents, the neighbors, we had solved the problem. The problem was a guy, you know, trying to beat up a a a woman on the street. They they were in a relationship, but a clearly abusive relationship, and he was trying to beat her up with like a you know, a long stick, and we the neighbors we got involved, and we start shouting at them, and and then eventually the guy let her go, you know.
But anyways, by the time that the police arrived it was too late. Is it because the police is lazy, I can assure you, because I work with police as well. It's those people are over there under staffed, and they are overloaded so like it's just so many calls. So again, so like Ali Alice, she raised that question.
Is it really worth it? I mean to kind of, you know.
to pursue, you know, like those mine or infractions, when you have big fish to fry right. So it's like.
and and and when you look at the statistics I didn't. Unfortunately, I didn't bring them in here. But I do have statistics. When you look at crime statistics in Canada, Like most court cases, they have to do with like violations of probation and parole. Anyways, this is a question right. Where do we want to put our police resource?
And another thing that you noticed in the article was that, you know, like like escaping police like it's like again. It's very rare that I mean. Once you are released.
put yourself. I invite you to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has been in prison. Okay, so you are in prison, let's say, for 5 years.
and in prison. I don't know how much you guys know about prison. But let me share something. There is something called a prison culture.
so that means what that means that, like, knock on wood, knock on the wood. Let's say that, you know I get arrested. Okay, and I commit a crime, and then I get, I get convicted and sentenced, and then I have, like, let's say, 5 years in prison. Okay.
once I am, I, I let's suppose I am a a person that I don't. I don't do any kind of, except for that crime that I did, which let's suppose it was in self defense. Let's suppose
I don't do anything illegal, or you know I I go by the books in my life. So at the moment that I I I I cross the gates of a prison, and I I become an inmate
for me to serve 5 in that prison. I ha it's almost like it's impossible for you not to commit, not to become deviant, not to do things that are wrong. So, for example, for me to survive in there at the moment that I arrived in there.
you know. People are gonna say, you know, like you. You want to live here. You want to like I'm going to be assigned a a cell
and then in my cell. But i'm going to have a cell mate, and then i'm going to arrive at my cell, and i'm going to see that there's no mattress. There's no covers. There's no blankets. There's no nothing.
and then I look at my cell mates
site, and and I see my pillow. My everything with my cell mate, and then my and that's okay. Excuse me, this is excuse me. Do you mind? This is my this is my you know, blanket people are gonna laugh at me. They're gonna say, what do you mean? This is mine, not yours. You just arrived in here. Apply yourself.
and then for you to get that stuff back. You're going to have to do a favor to someone
right so.
and that favor, usually in tales beating up someone stealing something from someone saying something to someone I mean it's it's people it's that's how things go in prison. So for me to get that you know, and have a place to sleep comfortable comfortably. I I might have to do something, and and so that's like. So the networks and sociability in prison.
It's it's very. It's almost nearly possible for you like not to get in that life, you know, in that kind of deviant kind of life.
To some extent we see that in movies.
But I can assure you from my research that this is real, I mean, you know. So so prison culture, prison culture in it per se. In itself
it makes you like in terms of criminality worse than when
when you first arrived. So it make the forces you to become deviant. Right? So okay, I stayed 5 years in there, and then I am out.
My My family doesn't have anything to do with me, or you know I have it's gonna be very hard for me to find a job because I have a record, you know.
because I don't have really how i'm gonna explain the last 5 years. I'll have to say that I had a record. People are not gonna want to employ me, you know. I'll. I'll have to sleep at, you know, halfway houses or shelters, because I won't have the money to pay rent, you know, and if I have them, if let's suppose someone agrees to rent me something
how i'm gonna make the money to pay so very quickly because I learned in prison how to, you know, Deal with drugs. I'm going to be dealing something. I'm going to be selling. I'm gonna or for me to survive even on the outside. I'm gonna have to go back and and find a connection from the prison, so you know, make a friend of a friend who has a place, and then that place that person will not do it for free. I'm gonna have to pay back somehow, and that usually day or some sort of deviance or crime. And you know, so you guys get what i'm saying like, you know it's it's really hard
for someone, you know. Once Once you're out and you have no money. You're Usually I didn't bring the statistics in here, but I will tell you that about 70% in Canada, about 70, 70, 77, 0. Of the people who are in prison.
I mean they had. They have a history of foster care, placement, meaning what meaning that they were as a kid like they were. They were an abusive family, or in a dysfunctional family, and and and a child Services took them away and put them in a foster care family. And then very often those folks were mistreated. I won't even say abused. I would say me streeted in foster care, because the the in Canada a lot of people who do foster care. They do for money, not because they care about the well being of children, but anyways, I mean, we have a kind of our system doesn't work. But anyways, it's another problem. So they have that, you know
care placement. So that means that you don't have family to start with. They have a family, but it's usually a family that is in trouble, or you know, and a lot of them. Their parents were in prison, so it's like. So it's very hard if you put yourself in those people's shoes. It's really hard for you to kind of keep.
you know.
for you to keep like once you are out of prison for you to actually.
you know, rehabilitate, or kind of, you know, find a job and and and make make something out of yourself. It's it's very, very hard because you don't have anybody to rely on. Just think about you folks.
how much, how how much support you guys get right like you get a lot of support from your parents, from your family, some sort of family, some sort of parents, some sort of someone I mean, some people help you somehow, right? So you and and imagine that you don't have all that support. Or actually you do have that support.
is all intertwined with Dvm: right? So that's the reality. So, anyway. So on Alice. So she was like, you know, seeing those people in for for for her
escaping like once you are released.
It's almost like inevitable. You're gonna get somehow your break the rule again because you're gonna have to meet someone. Then someone's gonna offer you a drink, you know, for you to, you know. And then you're gonna take a drink. And then you, you're not supposed to be drinking according to your you know, parole rules.
and then, you know, the police is gonna eventually find you and and send you back. So it's like it's very hard for you to get out of there now. Work. So she says that escaping policing it means to be on their run all the time.
and when you are on the run. Imagine, let's suppose you guys don't have a place to live.
You don't have a vehicle you don't, so that means that you're exposed. You are on the streets all the time, so you are like you enjoy hyper visibility. So you are hyper visible. Right? So
so. And then some people. They exploit that there's another layer of difficulty. Some people exploit that layer that that situation that you are hyper visible because they're gonna say, oh, I know that you know. I know that you're visible. I know that you're not supposed to be out. You have curfew. You're not supposed to be out on the street at this time. But again you have no other place to go, and I know that you are out. I know that you are sleeping. Let's say, by save on food somewhere. And then I report to you.
you know, like anonymously, I call the police, and I report you so. It's like in the police comes and catch you, I mean so it's like so people. And then they say, oh, they they do blackmail they they do a lot of black may, or if like like i'm talking about criminals doing blackmails on criminals right so like I know you are there. I say, look! Give me 50 bucks. If you don't, i'm gonna call the police on you. So that's what people do right? So you become extremely vulnerable hypervisor visibility.
So and visibility in itself is a risk right? So in people there's another layer to this whole problem that she found in her research, which nothing of I mean all of that for me at least, it's very obvious and very because I work with that kind of stuff. So so. But but so that's why some people said, people who some people said you know her books not a big deal, and some people were like oh, you know, it is very nice, because she actually details exactly how that happens with a lot of examples and everything right. So she gives a lot of examples. So that's why some people liked it a lot.
but but there is also an economy of risk.
and that's my last bullet point here on this slide, because a lot of the politicians they use that
they kind of capitalize on on that situation. So they say, oh, you know, there's this like you. Let's suppose i'm gonna run for Mayor in Toronto. And then I say, you know, we vote for me because you know, i'm gonna get rid of all those
you know, like i'm gonna clean up the Ghetto. I mean that kind of discourse. It sells super super Well, not only in Canada, anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world. In Brazil every election we elect a lot of people who's like Modal is just clean cleaning up. Get us cleaning up favelas, you know, like urbanizing favelas, I mean. And then nothing happens right, because I mean they don't pretty care. It's just like, you know, because they know that there is a lot of like concern all around
petty crime. So they want, you know they want to. They use that. So
So people
she also
she's gonna try to explain the logics, the logics behind you being on their run all the time and getting caught, and they being you know you're putting prison and you get caught, and then you're released, and then you you get caught putting prison release, and then
that caught again. This is gonna try to explain that. And she goes actually, she goes to her father actually, which is interesting in this staff
that she does not sign her father.
but she cites the people who cited her father. Okay, so it's interesting. I think she
void kind of, you know, kind of like
being her father such a big name in the field. So she cited to people who cited him. But that's what she's gonna say here. She's gonna say that we have a theory in criminology called labeling theory. Okay.
So what what you're gonna what what it like. This theory says that, you know, if you receive some sort of like deviant status. Okay, you're gonna actually become deviant. You're gonna act deviant.
So it's almost like you know. Let me let me give you an example that it has nothing to do with the the article.
When I teach social problems in Canada.
Now I actually, when I teach introduction to sociology.
and I have to teach them, You know, labeling theory. The example that I give is just like in in 19 eighties. Probably you guys remember that at that time HIV Aids was a huge like fear, a source of fear in society.
because there was no medicine for for that illness. There was no cure. Now it seems that we are on the verge of getting the cure. Some people even got, I think 3 or 4 people even got cured, but anyways, at that time was like very, very. It was a disaster, and it in a At this very beginning it affected mostly gay men, right? So at that time
So and the the problem was such that there's a lot of research on this that I mean in small cities especially, and also in big cities, but anywhere everywhere like if you were a gay guy at that time.
and and then Aids was around HIV Aids was around, and and because you were labeled gay like that's just let's suppose the Society calls you gain finger points that you all your G. This is bad. That was the mindset at the time. Right like this is wrong. You are, you know this is not what you, how you're supposed to leave your life and blah blah blah! And then and people would exclude you
what they would exclude you just like what we thought. Do you remember when we talked about full call, and
we talked about leprosy like the difference between that, like, you know, like so like people would exclude you, and then you would have no friends. You would have like, you know. Nobody would invite you for anything, and the only people who would accept you would be your you, the people who are like you.
or who suffered the same kind of discrimination.
So, as a consequence, you would go, and you would hang out with them, and then obviously you you would make friends there, and also you would find romantic partners in there, and you would have sex in there so, and and and eventually, and the likely, statistically speaking, the likelihood once you are excluded, and the only people that you're going to actually meet is that
people who visibly are discriminated because of visible features. You like the likelihood, statistically speaking, that you're gonna get HIV Aids, or as much higher right than if You were like living like able to, you know, to explore broader society when it comes to sexuality.
so that, like a lot of authors doing research with HIV Aids. They use labeling theory to explain, you know, like why, you know, like HIV, Aids was spreading extremely quickly.
Oh, you know, amongst like gay men, obviously I mean, there is also a biological explanation that says, I mean, it is a virus. So if you have to get, and then, like you're you know you could. You could explain another way. But sociologically the explanation did not emphasize the virus aspect of it, but more like
the social aspect like, okay, you were excluded. The only people that takes you is just that people that bar, you know, and then you go in there. And obviously it becomes very obsessed to us when I say set and says to us means like people having sex among themselves, and obviously their whole group is gonna come down eventually. If HIV aids right. So it's like, I'm. Just see the comments here.
Yeah, cause that that that that photo, Matthew, he changed. I remember I because you guys are younger than me, I believe. Right like I am 40. True, I'm gonna be very soon going to be 43.
So I was born in 1980, and I remember that when I was born I remember that one day I wasn't a party. There was a guy in there who had HIV Aids and my uncle, who was a doctor.
My uncle was a very liberal doctor, and a very good doctor, and my my uncle was one of the first doctors in my city to treat people who had HIV Aids because the doctors they didn't want anything to do with people who had HIV Aids. So there was this barbecue, and then my uncle was there, and he brought this guy in his family.
and this guy had HIV Aids, and he, this guy was marriage a woman, but probably he also was bisexual. We don't know exactly. Also, people would catch and doing drugs and stuff right like, so we don't know exactly how he got it.
but I remember that I wasn't. I was very. I was like 6 or 7. I was playing around in a big big farm. Not a farm kind of a, you know, a acreage with like barbecue and kids, etc. And then my mom was like, do you see that man over there, and I was like one man I mean, you know you are a kid. You don't even my mom was
Don't don't come close that person, and I was like so when I, when I remember that, like my heart kind of you know, like I feel kind of you know, sad about it like.
anyways, my mom's ignorance. But but you know, anyways, it was a lot of discrimination, and and I never remember that I I also thought
so that that photo from Diana. It meant a lot like for for the world, you know, like
I remember, in 2,005, I was teaching English in China just to make some cash money. I was like teaching some some kids and young people there, and I remember that I like like at that time HIV Aids in China was still a huge taboo.
and I said something. It was like, you know, like the HIV Day, when you, when you you know there's this little rainbow, the pink. I can remember. What was it I don't even remember if it's something rainbow. Anyways, there it was like the the the day that we actually it's for awareness for HIV. And I said something in my English class.
and and then I remember that one student came to me later and said, Marcella, this is disgusting. Never talk about this again, you know, like you met, and then, like I was like No, but it's not like that, you know. I try to kind of like it to the person kind of you know. And then they they told me. No, no.
even like you know this is highly contagious. I remember the the soon telling me this is highly contagious, even if you cut your hair with with like the scissors that someone else that that had HIV. You're going to catch it. I was like No, this is like like this, and Bl. But it was like crazy, anyway. So like people.
i'm using the example of HIV because it was
crazy. Okay, in society. It was like a lot of exclusion for people with HIV aids a lot of exclusion. But anyway, so this so this is it's it's there. Is it like you? Usually in sociology, books, or criminology, books or social Sciences book the another way that it's called. It is the self-
because self fulfilling prophecy. So if I call you all, you are horrible, you are you know you are something. And then the only people who you accept you is that something? And then you're gonna hang out with them, and then you're gonna become something. Is this clear for you guys? Is this like?
So she's saying that because you are pretty much
like the police is always after you and watching you so much and labeling you so much. Eventually you're going to give up, and you, you know, watch.
I am like, you know. I'm labeled that way, you know I might as well do it. You know what you know that feeling. Oh, you know people call me so much that even though i'm not I'm. One day you kind of you know what I might as well do it. So she was trying to explain that cycle, you know, in that in those terms.
So later you read this here. So, people, sir, and another thing that I want to note to you a lot of the a lot of her tax is just like examples, like situations where, you know, like like
you know, police is kind of, you know, doing surveillance on people. But one thing that I would like to to to highlight. Here is something about surveillance the way that surveillance happens. And she says that in the text.
guys are you there, or you you guys are not. There. Is this interesting, or you guys are elsewhere.
I'm having those little moments. Where
am I crazy? I'm. I'm. I'm talking to the walls here. Okay, okay, you guys, Are there? Okay, people? So she lived in this street called Which is she anonymized? Okay, this is not the real name. It's like 6 Sixth Street.
So she she says that surveillance in there was very different than than this, like the surveillance that full code described in his book. So she's going to say that surveillance
in full call, according to full call survey. Now you should know that because you did that in the exam, and also we we went through that together according
focal surveillance is meant to make people more compliant
right like. So it's like It's like to kind of
like in the plague. Plague versus a leprosy like the leper, so it's like it makes you compliant. It it like you regulate your life and your death. It it controls everything about you. That's what full call says that. That's how surveillance works. She is gonna say that in the case
of like off of the gate, or where she live. Surveillance. The purpose of surveillance was not to make people compliant, because one thing is to say, Look, people. I'm going to be watching you. Please behave well.
That's the kind of surveillance that we call talked about. Another thing is me saying, Look, I am gonna purposely. I'm going to be checking on you during the exam, and if you drink some water i'm going to flag you, and then i'm going to give you a 0. It's different. So the kinds of surveillance that they had in there was the Sec. Was the latter was the second kind.
It's like the the the kind that you know puts fear in people it it the purpose is not to make people compliant, but it's the purpose to catch them and throw them in jail again. So it's different kinds of events, different kinds of policing.
you know. So we can have a kind of policing that is kind of managed. Okay, look, Don't, do this. If you do this again, I'm going to give you a ticket. or you know, you know, don't speed again, because if you speed, i'm gonna take it you next time, or we can have this kind of police that's gonna frame you. They're gonna stop you. They're gonna like, you know, verbally abuse You give you a lesson and give you a ticket, and and that's it right like very oppressive
kind of police. Right so, and and I know that
we don't like those kinds of police. We we i'm sure. I I remember one day I I rent a car to go to a rental, and when I went to I I I booked the cheapest vehicle, you know, and when I went to get down the vehicle they gave me this people. I'm not a a vehicle person, so I don't know the names, but they gave me this conversible. They gave me the most expensive vehicle in the store, and was a sports view.
Cool I was like, oh, my gosh! How do I even drive this? Because I mean, this is not. I don't have that kind of stuff. I don't, and I don't know those kinds of things, but not interested in cars.
But the car was like it was a sports car, so if I just guess it a little bit like you know, it would kind of fly right. So I had a little bit of a difficulty adjusting, because I was used to a old car who would kind of go in. The car would not go, and then I, all of a sudden. I have the sports car, and I was too very obedient, with like the speed limits and everything. Obviously, that's who I am.
And then I was going from admin admin to beams. Do you guys know, like between Calgary and beams? There is that high up between them? Actually, Lake Louise, I was going to make up to camp in Lake Louise. So I was like between Ben and Lake Louise here in Alberta.
and I was going just like I like 199, 500. Everything was good. And then there was a big truck in front of me, actually not only one truck, but a truck and
a trailer. So it was like, you know, a a pick up truck, and then a trailer, and it was like kind of getting like 89 90 very slow, and I decided to, you know, to cut them, to pass them, and then for me to pass them. I had to kind of speed up a little bit, so I could just like, you know. Go ahead of them, and then
and pull on the right again like like just like you do.
But in the very second that I kind of speed up I went, a little bit like maybe a 110, a 115.
I went a little bit up, so to say, I could cross them.
and there is a place between Beth and Josh, where I know, because I I always camp in the area, so I know the area well. Like the police people like they always hide behind the bushes. You know there is like some bush in there. It's a place where you can turn and go with Kirk. You can turn around. They hang on if you guys know there, but they hiding there and then the police saw me, and obviously they stopped me.
you know.
and and obviously I got. I can't remember any more, thank God, I forgot, but I was like it was like a big ticket, and and I tried to explain. I was like I was like, please, sir.
Oh, this is a rental car. This is not my vehicle, you know I this is the first time, and and i'm not even speeding. I I promise you I left that meeting, whatever time I am, you know it's like 5 h. I'm not speeding or anything.
and and it's just like this car is very powerful, and also I was just cutting. I was passing. You know that those trucks that you just saw, and and the guy was like
your license, please. And then, like, you know, I gave my license, and I came back with like you know it. It spoiled my trip, because, like you know, like I can't remember. I think it was like a
It was like whatever maximum that they can give, you know, and and and and I was like super sad, and feeling feeling extremely unfair. I mean like that was a big in like, not not just at all, but again, so that when it happens to us we we kind of we feel it in the heart.
But when it happens to other people, that kind of lack of tolerance from the police, we don't care right like. That's how we feel about it, and that's what she describes in the book. So. And she says that you know, like the police power that she saw on the streets in that Ghetto was, you know, it was
a power that was not meant to produce orderly subjects. Some just means people right like orderly people
it was. But, in fact, if you want, the only way for you to be
orderly
would be too big to be caught, because I mean they would catch you, and you throw you so there! There was no space to educate you to give you a second chance. No, it was like, you know. So
so in in and and again, and how? But how can you follow the rules If you understand anything about being prison and and life after prison.
It's really hard to follow rules, because again, your entire social network is compromised. So you don't have a a place to sleep or anything. So you you know, people comments anything.
Oh, yeah, old Matthew. You know that that's exactly there. That's where I got it, you know.
Okay, let me see. Joyce. Question here would surveillance meant to punish others, be less visible.
usually usually join. It is usually surveillance that's kind of more focused on, which is like to do compliance. It it tends to be more
like invisible, more can settle in the surveillance that's meant for punishment. It tends to be more visible. That's not always the case, because
oh, look at the u of a. We have a lot of cameras right like they're very visible, very kind of in your face. Well, we got used to them, but like they are in our face, right like, and they are not really meant to. They are like, you know.
They they can be meant for both for compliance and for so, but usually yes, usually. Yes. So okay, people, any comments or anything. Do you guys understand? Do you guys feel it in your heart when I try to describe how hard it is for you, with like a a record for you to survive in society. Once you've been in prison.
do you? Do you? I mean, does it like get to you? Because for me, before I I was not very. I was like, oh, okay, yeah, it's hard. But whatever get over it, I kind of had that. I mean a little bit kind of mentality. But today, after
like kind of like working with prison and doing research in prison and with prison I kind of I can't see it. I can see I mean it's nearly impossible. So that's why recidivism so so high, right? Like.
Yeah, and that's the thing I mean. And again, I don't think the people I am. Don't don't get me wrong. Okay, because I mean I I I still think that someone who committed the crime who broke social arms, that person, that that person needs some sort of re repercussion. I mean, you can't just kill someone, you know, steps someone, and and do like, you know, wrong to someone and not get some sort of
punishment, because, after all, society is, of course, coercive. Society is about like we have to follow rules.
but I also. But again, but i'm not like, you know. I used to be like oh, you know those people. They should just apply themselves after prison, but it's not not that easy, you know it's not easy at all. Actually, it's nearly impossible. You know. It's impossible. Almost
so.
Anyways, let me just show you some reality from Canada and the United States very quick. So you you're gonna get your i'd like you. You don't have to memorize those figures for the example. I would like you to know them.
because if you think about them, you're gonna know. I'm not gonna ask those figures in the exam. Let's establish that. But I would like you to know, since you're taking my course so like you to kind of know that because that kind of
when you're talking to people and you're making arguments is nice to know. You know the reality on the ground. So in the United States people in the Us. Is the country in the world that incarcerates the largest amount of people.
So what she said, what Alice said about the gear in Philadelphia applies to many, many places in the United States, or, I would say, most places in the United States. Okay, so it's really hard to kind of once you are out to kind of stay out.
you know, and then you have to leave that life on the run, and then you can't really, you know, be yourself, and that makes your whole individuality. I mean it. It's extremely course that that's what it is. So we have about 1.2 million people.
This is like the like. Alberta has 3 about 3 million people. So this is like a third of Alberta. This is the number of people that in the United States has in prison incarcerated.
And just so, you know
I'll talk about Canada, too. But let's talk about the Us. First. So in the Us. People we have about like to. We have the Federal prison system. We have this State prison system
and all the county jails. They are in the State. Okay. So the Federal prison prison system is for heinous crimes crimes that are usually sentenced to like more than a year. In some it varies a little bit, but he has to be like some sort of hardcore criminal offence.
So we have about 12. Only 12 of those one media almost like 1.2 million people are in Federal prisons in the United States.
Most of the people in the Us. They are in state prisons, and also county jails. In fact.
most of those people who are arrested about set of those 1,700,000. They are in county jails, and they are waiting for trials. They're like they were either a a sentence to like a a few months
for Paddy crime, or they are waiting for trial in county jails. And look
here's gender. Crime is extremely. It's a huge gender issue, because when you look it's it's male committing for Mo. For the most part the whole criminal world is men on men, men committing crimes on men, women. They usually appear only as victims.
and when they appear it's it has to do with sexuality in sex, so it's like usually sexual self or sexual harassment, and they usually appear as victims victims of sexual self. Sexual harassment. Right? So so that's it's a very small chunk of people, as you can see here.
You know that you know it's you know. It's a women. And and again, and those women in like like like the the guys to most cases they were like they were criminalized. They were victimized before right. So it's very. It's very unusual to find someone in prison
who was not victimized in their
past life before prison, you know, very unusual. So so this is just like me highlighting this. And then here I'd like to show you this true, because people talk a lot about the Us. And like when we like. When we look at the United States, the the States, with the largest amount of incarcerated people.
It's California. It's the big States, California, Texas, and New York State, Florida. However, those states there that's not
where we see the highest incarceration per capita. If you want to look at incarceration per capita, like South Dakota, is at the top of the list, and then we have Vermont, and then we have Kentucky. Those are, you know, like the top of the list. So you kind of know one thing is number of incarcerated people. Another thing is incarcerated per capita, right like.
because, like the population of California, Texas, and Florida, it's just like so big, much bigger like they're per copy of, like, you know, a number is not so high, right? So it gets, you know.
so like in the United States. If you ever think about like those problems that are discussing, like, you know life on the run, and you know, and and and policing you gotta you got there is like, Usually I I usually tell people that there's true. There are many problems for you to think about, but 2 problems
that really deserves attention is recidivism, which speaks directly to what Alice is talking about in her book and her article that you're going to read. So look at this recidivism. People in the United States. It's 70. It's. It is at 71%.
So it's almost like.
you know, in each, in each, like 100 people who are released
every day. 71, we'll get back in the next 5 years, so like usually recidivism or real fence re offending, we calculate in 5 year term like. So you know we we.
because we we need to give some people time for them to real fan. Right? So usually it's 5 years. So you know, within the 5 year term, like 71% of the 171 people out of a 100. They come back to prison, and and that has with that life on the run. And how do they survive. Until then, you know
life on the run, you know.
So another thing that I want to say here to you is that in Canada, unfortunately.
the Canadian Government does not report our risk to division the provinces they do.
but the the Federal Government they don't. We just very problematic.
and I would like you to invite just for a second. This is like, you know, surveillance studies, criminology like. Does it mean that prison doesn't work? You know.
What do you guys think when you look at this recidivism extremely high, you know those petty crimes that she describes in her article people trying to survive outside and then going back eventually. Does it mean
that prison does not work?
Come on, people. Where are you guys?
No, comments.
I mean for me personally, at least.
it.
It is kind of a double edged sort, because, yes, some people do in a way need to be incarcerated because they do serve a general
risk to all of society.
However, there has to be like a better way, where, like instead of them, just like sitting in a cell staring at a wall, we actually do try to like, make them work more with the community. So they have more like higher attachment to it.
So when they have that they'll.
they'll feel more invested in there. You are less like we do offensive.
great. I agree. I can't agree more. I can't agree more with what you're saying.
But the difficulty. Do you know what's the do you know what's the obstacle to implement what you're saying?
The obstacle is that in Canada you cannot force people to do anything that they don't want.
and and not everybody wants to to do what you're saying. You know what I mean. Like not every May somebody, mates, some I we the actual name people
today's term knowledge is resident. We don't call any mates anymore, because it's a little bit kind of you know. Anyways, I I used to call prisoners now. I'm calling residents, but call how how? How you find it's the best way, but, like the the some residents. They don't want to do that. They just want to do their time. They just want, you know. Leave me alone, kind of thing, you know.
and then, when you propose anything of it, this is like a a good chunk of them, you know, and that's some. That's a sad reality, because you see that people. They have been dehumanized to a point that
you know it's almost like. Leave me alone. I don't want to talk to you, and you know I just want to stay here, Jessica, please.
Could we possibly associate that with like the culture around prisons like the fact that do your time is kind of like an option.
So if we were to possibly remove the option.
and we just create the environment and like kind of we.
we basically, manipulate the external environment to create the mentalities that we want. Because, yeah, the prison system is so old it is so long, and we do have like these ideas of No. When you get incarcerated you're just sitting in a room for however long your sentence is. But if we kind of remove that choice.
we. I mean it might actually save money, because you're not having to like.
For lack of better words, entertain these people. They would, in fact, be working
to actually, you know better themselves, and possibly better, their communities, which would
have lower incarceration rates, would basically change the community and remove the option, to begin with, of just sitting in your cell and waiting.
I I I think, yeah, I fight. I also agree with you, and I think that this figure, this is something that all of us, for you guys are interested in criminologies. Otherwise we wouldn't be taking this course, because this is, of course, situated in criminology. Right? So it's like this is a number that I think all of us citizens. We should have this in mind, because, again.
you know, this should inspire us because it cost a lot of money. It's a $146,000 for a Federal prison for you to keep a person there. It's extremely expensive.
you know it's not effective, right? So it's like. And and then I you like clearly what I see. At least me I mean. This is my opinion here. My interpretation of this figure. Clearly, clearly, reason is not working as rehabilitation that is not working
their role. It's not happening. What I see that's happening is incapacitation like we are actually putting people away. It's like almost like correctional officers. They talk of prisoners being a warehouse right like it's just a warehouse of people that you don't want in society.
but is do you do? And then it goes to what Jessica? Very well put out there. Do we actually want to have that.
Do we want to have this place? Because that's what we're doing as a side we're creating this building where we throw them in there and say, look, stay there! I am wheeling as a taxpayer to pay $145,000 per head you know per year. So you stay put in here, and you don't disturb my neighborhood. That's what we are doing right now.
It's it's like we're just incapacitating them.
and I would like to invite you guys to watch. I'm going to put that on F on on a class as well. There's this professor here at the ovation is really good. I really like her work. Her name's Sandra Sandra Boserius. She's a Jeremiah woman. She's a prophet, a criminal, you know, professor of criminology at the U. Of a.
And she has this Ted Talk on how prison prisons they are becoming shelters, especially here in Canada, because of the winter so harsh, and you have no place to stay. If you are leaving that life on the run, you know
you, you might as well go back to prison. So you have food. You have a place to have your community. You have something right. So, and I When I first heard I saw her, Ted Talk
and I I first thought about this idea.
I was like. This is crazy. Come on, she's telling me that people prefer to go to jail. That was before I get myself like very in depth into prison research.
And now I actually put out the text. I wrote to anyways that I I wrote something like a, and I analyzed the interviews that I did with like a 70 plus officers.
and they were all saying that I mean that can, that because of the harsh winter people. They do some petty crime that they know the the the you know inmates. They know the the criminal code very well, so they know they study sentencing. They know sentencing very well, so they do something that will get them convicted to just like 6 or 7 months, or, you know, or 4 months just enough so they can, you know, do the winter, and then they can be back on the street again, and then they can enjoy just like us.
you know they will enjoy this their summers, and then they enjoy this summer, and then they go back again in the winter. So so there is this Ted Talk. I I wrote this announce in case you want to read. I'm going to put it that talk for you by Sandra, and but this is a reality in Canada. And look at what's going on with us that people are. You know that prison became shelter. I
for me, if I tell that in Brazil people are going to like, really, I mean, you know. And this is shame on us, on on us Canadian society, you know.
So let me see here.
Oh, yeah, exactly, Kathleen, you're very right. You're I. I also thought of of Angela when you when I read this, when I thought when I read the speakers and stuff. I I You know you're right.
Your
Yeah. Exactly, Matthew. You're right, you know, and it's very sad. That's what it is. It's very sad. So people here. I just want to share this very quick with you because my time is up. Oh, I can't believe I wish I had more time. You know.
I hate kind of crumping a lot of stuff in one lecture, just for the sake of giving the lecture, you know, like anyways, people. Over incarceration of black Americans is huge in the United States. I'll just tell you. Here, look you, you read those figures later
nationally one in 81 black adults. They are in prison in the Us. This is awful. This is like statistically. This is just like.
you know. So, and they are in case you wonder black folks in the United States? They are 12% of the population.
Okay, but they are almost 40% of all the residents in prison.
Let's move to Canada. Here I have a few minutes on to Canada. Our situation in Canada is not much better. It's actually the same, or even worse, because if we consider that we are a smaller country, we should be doing much better than the United States, and we are not.
you know. And but our problem here is not with like a black Canadians, but with indigenous Canadians. So this figure here
it takes whatever for a steadily to
to to update, you know, like though, that those stable so my table is old.
I do have this data from other sources scattered, so I know that it's it's about the same. It hasn't changed much. And but look at this. Let's look at Alberta. So this is 41 is the percent
of of indigenous people in custody in Alberta. So you go into any prison in Alberta. Let's say Edmonton Institution, and you're gonna see about 80 40 of the people in there. They're indigenous people. But look.
this 5. Here is the percent of indigenous people in in Alberta society. So we have only 5% of our society is
indigenous people. and then, when we look at prison it's 41.
And again, remember.
we're i'm i'm telling you it's extremely rare to find someone in prison who has not been victimized before, and who, before going to prison, and also, like virtually everybody, not not everybody. What 70. They have a a history of foster care placement. So
you know. So look at what we are doing. We've indigenous people of this country that's not a problem, you know. And and again we need to in there. I mean, this is when I teach social problems. I go deep. I bring some like archive documents for people to analyze in class, but like in Canada people
we like.
Anyways, I I won't. I won't get talking about. I won't talk too much about it, but like, but it's I just want to give you one figure
40 40% of the indigenous children
in Canada today. This is data from last year they are in poverty.
So it's like. What do you think that's gonna happen in the future?
So we we are trying very hard in Canada to to like to pass policies that will help us decline the number of of indigenous people in prison. They are over representation, but it's not working.
Actually, the representation of indigenous people in prison in Canada is increasing. Unlike in the United States, in the United States, they are actually, perhaps even doing it a good job, because, like the number of incarcerated people. I didn't say that is the declining, and the representation of black people is declining. It's far, far, far from better. But it's happening.
But what i'm gonna I Won't have time, but I have 3 more minutes.
There is this article that I love because it's going to tie back to what Allison said
in her article.
You don't need to read, but it is an article that tries to explain it's it's by it's. It was published in 2,000, and 20 in the
2,018
by this personate Jackson. I really like this article because he explains exactly why we are like one of the challenges that you know that we are facing to to to make the number of indigenous people in prison decline. I'm not. I'm gonna continue this next class.
However, I would like to say something to you before you guys go
like the one of the biggest problem I'll i'll keep, and i'll come back to this later. But I want to say this here
One of the biggest problems that we have in Canada is exactly what Alice described in her article.
Exactly what she described the problems. It lies with policing
the the way like, for example, in Canada, when you are policing someone on the street, let's say I am a police person at y Avenue, and i'm watching. You know this is Saturday night. I'm watching white app. I'm doing surveillance on white app, and then I catch someone like Jay walking.
I can give them a ticket or I can not give them a ticket. If that person is indigenous person, they're gonna look up in the system. They're gonna see that that person has been in jail before, and they will get a ticket. Are they gonna have money to pay. No.
Let's suppose that they, you know they are caught in some sort of
fight or something on. Why Dev.
like the police officer, has a chance, has the option to give people just like
like what like a
they have the option to give people like a judicial measure extra judicial measure. It means just a wording like the stop with that behavior. Don't do that anymore. So that's called judicial measure. That's what the police officer can give, but they also have the option to give an extra judicial sanction, so may one measure another. One is sanction. So if I give you a sanction, that means that that goes in your record.
so that it's kind of you know it feeds their record, so measure it doesn't. Go in your record, but the sanction goes, and and the function requires admission of guilt. So you know, so everything gets filed. So it's surveillance being like, you know, it's about data, collection, etc., etc., right? So you
so, anyway. So we're going to come back in here. But, like the police
play, I mean the the style of police style plays a huge importance because police comes before prison. So you know, so like Ha! The way that you police your community.
it's going to influence the amount of people that you have in prison, and the kinds of people that you have in prison. So anyways, we're going to come back to that, but that i'll speak to visibility people. You know how to the police people view the waters.
and that's extra training. So we're going to come back to this discussion next class. Okay. I look forward to. So we're gonna i'm gonna cramp a little bit next. I'm gonna be like this. I'm gonna finish this and then do the other slide a set that I had for today that I didn't have time to do it.
But but that's it for today. People so think about okay, put yourself in people's shoes. Start to kind of okay, would I? You know my my invitation for you is, just think about If you would be able to do the things that you do. If you were, if you had a record, okay, and how visible that the surveillance of it. Right? So thank you very much.
You guys take care. And, Lily, I'm going to read you here.
Yes, exactly. This is exactly that, I mean, and that speaks to what the Jessica said right like that, you know. If you can make prison kind of more like a like real society, or you can, you know, apply real society or something that you don't have that up that up to you. You're going to see in there just like she said. She said, that so I won't say, but I think that's that's the point they they can mimic, you know.
and and then that means that for surveillance you enjoy the same level of visibility as any other person. You don't have to be on the run right like. So so anyways, people, thank you very much. Okay, You guys take care of ourselves
yourselves
is a judicial sanction Doesn't our record get removed once complete your I didn't get your question among, but it goes in your record, and it doesn't disappear it doesn't get removed, you know. Is that your question among
in the adjacent section? Does our record get removed? Once you complete your dispositional. It does not.
It stays there forever. Okay. So you're gonna have always that record. So
and that's why surveillance is really per pervasive, right? Like No, it stays there.
Maybe just one more comment, maybe, and that would have to look up this. Maybe one thing that is possible is that after like you, you complete your disposition like that. That record cannot be used in court.
Maybe i'll have to check this, but the police can still see it. That record is still in some data set somewhere where the police can access, you get the point.
So even if I cannot use that in court against you anymore, I as a police person, I can run you up, and I can see that, and that can guide my behavior.
Is Does it make sense what i'm saying here like, do you understand?
Hey? Good. Yeah.
I think, Sara, do you have a comment or some? Oh, no! Who can You guys are there just for I appreciate your comments, your questions. Thank you very much.
Just stop sharing here so we can.

Mar 16

"Okay, folks. Hello, everybody, Welcome back. Nice seeing you.
We don't have a lot of people here yet. But for what we're gonna get more people I do have like an email. I think it's by joy in my email box that I said, oh, i'm gonna reply during the weekend, and I I did not have the time. I actually I was busy on Saturday.
I worked on Sunday morning, and then on Sunday after I forgot. I'm sorry. So i'm gonna go back to that. Okay?
So i'm sorry about it. It's just like it's been crazy people research season data, collection, season writing season. It's always season, right? So.
But i'll I'll I'll get to you. Okay, Joy
people. Okay. So we were discussing Alice Goffman's article. Okay, so i'm gonna pull my slides back, and I remember that I we talked a little bit about how like the difficulties that people have navigating life Once you have a record, and how kind of police they, You know the the police is made in a way that it's not to kind of.
You know. Kind of give you a second chance, but it's the opposite. It's like policing quite often it is. It's in a way that
so, if you have something to fear, if you have something to hide. And if you're doing something wrong, and if you have policing, you know, like tailing you, it it's really hard for you to actually, you know, like
like saddle and get a job and and try to build some new networks. So that was the topic of the article, right? Her ethnographic research. So, folks, i'm gonna get back my slides, because then I I show. I remember that I showed you some stats from the United States. Just kind of giving you like, you know, the dimension of the of the of incarceration in the United States. I told you that we have about 1.2 million people in the United States.
I told you that a lot of them they are in in county jails about 700,000 people. They are in county jails like that would be our equivalent to, you know, to a city jail, you know. And and I also told you that the bulk of that is people who they breach their probation.
and it's like people who you know the they. They had some curfew. They have some rules that they had to obey, and they breach the rules, and then they went back to prison.
and when we stopped we were going to talk about indigenous people in Canada, and I was going to show you how the situation for indigenous people who have a record. It's not much much different than what we see for black folks in the United States. Okay, in terms of policing and the kinds of policing that we we have here in Canada. Before I I I I move on.
I was doing some. I was like, you know, like Dr. Hagerty, he has the Cr, the crime center, and I was like getting some data for him. You know I was like we were discussing something, and I went to check the data. I don't want to. I won't. Give you the data. I have it here in case you're curious, but like when we look at all the court cases in Alberta.
all the court cases in a given year, you know we're like a huge chunk of them, like I would say, about 60 70% of them. They are like like people who broke their probation rules. So imagine people
like. I mean this: Our criminal justice system is built in a way
that I mean it's just so much money into goes into chasing people like surveillance in them, surveilling them once they are in the community, and then, you know, and then a lot of money when it gets to court. Because again, if if I broke my my cur few hours whatever, then I'm throwing in jail, and then you know, and then, like my case, goes to court again, and then like, Look at how much money goes into this, and then I go back to prison again. So this into the cycle next.
never ending cycle. It goes a lot. It's like literally, of taxpayers money every decade, and and the system clearly doesn't work clearly doesn't work
A. And and again, we as taxpayers. We just, you know we just a lot of us. We don't even know a lot of the a lot of us. We just don't care, and or in a small part of as we say, yeah, yeah, just you know, just just change those people and throw them in jail, which I can't understand. But again, but
think about the money right like in and think about the waste. But anyway, so this is like it, Kazakhstan. It's just like
It's just setting people for fail, and any you know, and it's almost like I'm gonna share something with you guys as a. As a Prof. I I have. I I've been teaching. I teach a lot because I really enjoy teaching, and I think that I mean you know it's like teaching is just like a way to mobilize knowledge, to exchange. It's about my growth.
you know. I also grow a lot when i'm teaching, so I love teaching right so, and I teach a lot, and I teach if there is always a chance for me to teach how we always teach. So so why i'm saying that because
I I have a lot of friends for teachers at the UV. At that Concordia and elsewhere. And I don't know if you guys understand. I mean, I don't know if you guys see that what i'm gonna to to tell you, but a lot of the pros and teachers.
they have so many rules in their courses like they take, they take presence, They do this, they do that, you know, they create like they create this environment of rules, a lot of rules.
And then, obviously, if you have so many rules.
it's very easy for a students to break some rule, and then, you know, get in trouble with the grade right. So it's like I don't know if you guys understand. I'm saying, like the more rule.
the more rules you create you can be in society can be in your household, in your family, in your teaching, the more likely.
like people will actually break them, because you just have so many rules that it becomes impossible for you to survive without actually breaking some of them. And you may or you may not get caught. So I tell my my peers the people who also teach you. And look, they'll create so many rules. Why, you're doing that, although because you know the students, they gotta learn. I gotta teach them a lesson like.
Are you sure you want to be a teacher? I ask them right. I mean, you know teaching is not about that. Teaching is about to exchanging, and those people there
as adults as you are, and they know their responsibilities as much as you do, so there's no need for that. If you start to kind of create so many rules, it's going to give you a headache because you're going to spend your time, not like preparing your lectures and and enjoying the time that you have with the people who take your course. But you're gonna You're gonna spend all your time punishing people and and writing them mad emails right. So like, anyways, a lot of the teachers when I say that they don't get it. Why, i'm saying this to you because the same thing is with parole.
right? Like. If you
release someone in society, and you give so many rules for someone you say, Look, you have to be at home. You have to be home by 80'clock. Pm. You cannot be out before 80'clock am. You can't drink. You cannot come close to drugs. You cannot do this, you can after the decade, but I come from a family where everybody has been in jail. Everybody has. Everybody does drugs, everybody drinks, and the only place that I have to live right now is my You know my cousin's couch, and my cousin's call to my my cousin is a drug
dealer or or he's a drug users, I mean, how can I? How can I be away from that? So i'm not saying we have to be careful here, because, indeed, a lot of the people were in prison. They committed their crimes because they were high on something, you know like. But but again, but we have to be kind of.
We cannot be like dummy, you know, to create so many like a rule, the rules that we put on people.
He absolutely must be only those rules that are truly, truly, truly necessary. Otherwise, of course, they're gonna keep breaking them. And you're gonna keep chasing them, and you're gonna keep sending them to jail because of stupid things like you know what I mean like, and that's gonna cost taxpayers in society. I'll
a lot of money, right? And and not to make sure that that's gonna damage the community because we tend to think about the people who are in prison. or, you know. But yeah, the people were in prison. But behind that person we in prison there's always a family.
I was talking to someone another day, who is also a researcher and very good research. And this person told me, yeah, Mar Sala, because it's almost like prison, is a kind of punishment for people who broke the law.
but it's also a kind of punishment for for your families, right? Because I mean your families. If I get sent to breathe, get sent out to prison. My family won't see me. I won't. You know what I mean like. So it's it's it's very complex. Right. So beer yeah, Jessica, you guys, I think you guys get it there. So look, let me just share.
Yeah, I'm: I'm: i'm all good because of that. You know it's setting up people for failure. So and again. No, I mean I personally, a lot of the pros. They are abolitionists. They want to and prison. I think I, this is my personal mistake. I I come from country where criminality is just very high, and I see a lot of people suffering because of that. And I personally believe this is my personal belief that you know I mean.
we need prisons or we need we are. We need some sort of repercussion.
We cannot let people break the laws and just like, oh, it's okay, You're lovely. It's. Okay, Never mind, like, you know, especially when we're talking about sexual south martyr, you know, like like like like you know, like violent crimes.
But but yet I am also conscious and cognizant that the prison that we have right now this prison doesn't work. It's not working, you know, and it's costing us tax figures, a fortune, a fortune like a Federal corrections, Federal
corrections, not the provincial corrections all over like in Canada we have 43 Federal prisons last year. It cost us 2.5 billion
a 1 million dollars 2.5
1 billionIf you don't believe this speaker, just Google Csc. Which stands for correctional service. Canada Departmental report 2,021. And then you're gonna find you're gonna find that it's like. It's like a way too much money, you know, into the system that's not working right. So
i'm curious. What is your opinion on the or yeah, I, Matthew, I think that like it, someone actually less class said something about it, and that the person was very accurate on what they say. I can't remember who was it but like? But the point is that like there
it's like in in Norway, Norway, Sweden. They mark what they do is their prison is a repercussion. but it is like not in a way that you're going there, and you sit in your cell all day. No, it's like No, you look. You. You gotta make something out of you. You gotta go study. You gotta be. It's kind of a system that you know that forces you to study, to find a job to, you know, to be a kind of compliant member of society.
So it's not the system where you're going. There, and you sit and you have. Here's your cell, and you're gonna stay here. It's not a shelter, You know it's really. You know it's it, it it it forces on you a new reality. And in Canada
it's. In Canada we have a kind of 20, a catchy, 22, because we have a very strong human right movement which we are very strong human rights movement, which I
greatly appreciate. That's one of the reasons that i'm in Canada, because I think that you know human rights here is a serious topic, but it's a catchy 20. Why, I say that because the very human rights movement that they don't want, like, you know, like they don't want this kind of reason. They want a new system that they decrease because doesn't work and etc., etc. They don't allow the government. They don't agree either with the Government
forcing
anything on anyone.
because that doesn't speak to our like mindset like Liberal, so I can't like the government in Canada Doesn't. If I get to jail they they're not going to tell me, Marcella, you when you killed someone. You were high on drugs. Therefore
you you don't have an option. You're gonna have to rehabilitate. You're gonna have to get talks. It's it's forceful. I mean, or you know, kind of like it. It's all forceful that you're not gonna tie me in, and you know, and put me No. But like they push you really hard, and they make you kind of go. You know they have a system that it's kind of, but not when it's a course there's not torture people or or physical. No, but it's like it's a system that works in a way that pushes you into that. No
like in in Canada the way it works in our jail is okay. If you want to do it, you do it. If you don't it's fine, too. So a lot of the correctional officers that I interview. They are very frustrated because they say Look.
come on, it's just like they tell me they tell me all the time in my interviews myself. It's just like students, you know. You have to give them some rules. You can't just say, you know Schwabi here whenever you
what you take the exam whenever you want, if you want to take it, you take. If you don't, you don't. I mean, we don't have that even in this school system, but like that's what they see in the prison system. Like, you know, a lot of the like. The officers. They go literally knock at the cell and say, Look, it's time for your program. You have to wake up and you have to go, you know, to this, you know, drug whatever violence, you know, anger management, whatever programming, and they they say, No, I didn't want to go today.
and that's fine. It's fine, Nothing happens.
You guys get what i'm saying. It's a very complex situation here.
Obviously this is not all the inmates or all the residents prison, right? But a lot of them, you know, and I understand why I understand. I mean if if I come from like a very destroyed family, if I was abused, if I was like, you know I am kind of the at my lowest point. I mean prison.
Nobody cares about me. I'm gonna say I don't give it them care about this. You know what I mean like. I can't understand them, too, but I mean
but the what we have right now doesn't work, and and I think that what the beauty of the the you know, the the systems in in Denmark Suite, SW. SW Sweden and Norway is that you kind of? They manage to do that they manage to kind of say. Look, you know, I don't know
exactly what they doing there, because, you know, I I have never done like. I. I just read the other People's work. I've never like, you know, did research in there, and and even the research, the materials that are available. They Don't really detail
how how the the correctional system in there entice people to actually, you know, like kind of like, you know, build themselves and say, okay, I can. I can do better than this I can. I can prevent my life, you know
joy has there been recent research on the use of token economies in prison.
Yes, I've seen it. But but I've seen what the research that I've seen it it's. I've seen research in Canada like you know, saying that I mean that you know, if you do you, what you mean is like if you do this and that you get some point, or you get some money. Is that what you mean by token economy
just for us? Okay, yeah. So we do have that in Canada and Canada has that, you know. I mean, like in Canada you get you get money, for if you are an inmate, a resident, you do get money for for each with 10 programs, or you get points, or you get money that you can spend in in the cafeteria. But again, but they don't care people
because they also can get money through other sources such as drugs. Okay, I don't know if you guys know that, by the way, in in canada
the prisons, they don't have X-rays, which which for me, it's like unbelievable. I mean, we have X rays everywhere.
like at the airport. Why can't we just put on like the same kind of system that we would have for an airport. Why can't we just have that for prisons in Canada just to kind of I mean, I believe that it would be impossible to 0 the the amount of drugs in prison. But I mean but what we have right now it's. It's like
It's not okay, because we like one of the main problems that correctional officers have in which, by the way, becomes an occupational health and safety problem is like dealing with all these over those like you have to kind of. You know. You go in there, and you, you know I mean, I have students who
I don't even need to give the the example of of the of the prison. I I have a student who took a course with me, and she went to work in in a shelter here at maintenance. She'd really like it. She became a full time permanent worker in there. I actually talked to her another day, and she was telling me, Marcel, I'd say extremely traumatizing when you have to do all the on someone like, over and over and over and over again. So she told me that in some cases she does all the you know she's tries to. Oh, the person doesn't know the you have to rescue right like.
So she was telling me that she sometimes she has to rescue the same person 5 times a day.
I mean that heart is not going to take it Eventually she's gonna end up with someone dying her hands. I mean, this is extremely traumatizing, you know. Let me just see here also your thoughts on prison, escaping legal in Germany and other countries.
Matthew. I can't speak to that because I don't know the reality. You know I would need to like to give you kind of a I don't want to just give opinion. I want to like, you know. I want to know what's going on and understand, so I can't speak to that. But I do welcome your
thought and opinion if you have one, because probably you know, you know what's going on, you know by judging from your question so.
and and so feel free to jump in here or in the chat. So people let me just share my slide, so we can actually start like this slide part. So so, anyways, it's so. It's really, you know it's really it is like
It's
It's really complex. You know, like for you to kind of once you've been in prison for you to stay out. It's not a an easy task, you know. So, people I wanna. So last time we talked, let me just double this thing. Here, hold on a second.
Okay, so I told so. I told you I gave you some horrible horrible data from the Us. Like like saying to you that you know, like one in each like almost 80, you know, like American.
like a like like one in in in in 81 black Americans They are in prison, I mean. This is just like
I told you this, and I told you that the black population in the United States is only 12% of the population in yet they are 38 for almost 40% of the prison, you know, right like, you know. Just so in a lot of that is recidivism. A lot of that is re offending. So that's why I brought this data for you, because it's like.
So you kind of see the cause, I mean. Sometimes we think about. Oh, you know, we have this amount of people in
reason, and we tend to think oh, it's it's it's all people who committed the home side a murder, no people, the largest majority. It's petty crime property crime when it's a proper crime, I mean, you know.
Excuse me like the theft.
you know, like stealing, like you know, from the supermarket from here, from there like break and enter. A lot of it is breaking into. I'm. Not. Those things are not okay. Obviously. I mean, you know, I don't want to be, you know, stolen. I don't want to have anybody breaking into my my flat, my unit, but I I I understand that I mean
we have to find another way, because to put them in praise, and it is too expensive, right like.
And then I told you that. Let's look at Canada, and I told you that my data is not really updated for Canada, because it takes whatever for Canada to update those statistics that you have in front of you.
However, the numbers I know, because they they do like scattered updates. The numbers are pretty much the same. So in Canada we have 4%. 4%. 4% of the population is indigenous people.
and they are about 40% is even so. It's on a scale. It's worse than the United States, because in the United States the black population is 12, and they are about 40% of the people in prison. In Canada they are for only for 1 2 3 4. We're talking about like, you know, less than a 1 million people about a 1 million people, and and they are, you know, and they are like, well hold on a second 1%.
Yeah, 4, but 4% of the population. So and they are like 40% of the prison population. So I told you in Alberta I mean, we have, you know, like a like. We have 5 of our population here in Alberta, and we have 3 million people, so 5 of that they're indigenous. And when we look at our prisons, 40% of them, they are indigenous people. So again, babies, they are not born in prison
right? Like people are not born in prison. So they got in there somehow. So the question that is always lingering is, what is happening that our indigenous people are in the deep reason overall. You're just bad, I mean.
I I can't as a sociologist that I always look at society and social problems. I can't believe that
you know, like that doesn't make sense statistically right. So it's like something's happening, and so side somehow is placing them in a situation that it's. It's it's compromised.
But by anyways, this is not my social problem Class i'm going to move on so because we have this huge problem in Canada with the over representation of indigenous people in prison.
I, you know.
like our criminal justice system.
is trying to kind of create policies and change this somehow. And this article that I mentioned last class is actually addressing the changes and the changes they have to do with policing. So that's why we're discussing here in this class. So the first thing I don't have to tell you is that so?
We took a lot of measures to try to kind of reduce that share of of indigenous people in prison. One of the biggest one that we've taken in Canada was the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Okay, that applies to all key.
It's not only digital schemes, but that was very useful. I mean, that was okay. This, you know, that might help also be just kids, because they are much more likely to go to jail and like as juvenile because of the kinds of families that the experience, because of the the situated social problems that surround their individuals like in the individual lives. Right? So so the criminal, just the the the the the why Cja approved in 2,003 was very, very important for that.
But that was not enough. Just like a as a spoiler. Here
our numbers, the share of indigenous people in prison in Canada continues to rise, continues to rise. It's not declining. Unlike in the United States, where the share of black people in prison is declining, and also the number of people in prison in general is declining our number. General number of people in prison is declining, but the share of indigenous people is going up. Okay. So anyways, another thing that we did
at was in our criminal code. If you Google, our criminal code and you download the Pdf: If you find to control, search this section called 718.2, you're gonna see that one says in there is that whenever the judge is gonna like sentence, Someone
that judge that justice needs to look for, you know, Has this person this offender being a victim of hatred?
Has this person been a of hate as a victim of abuse, sexual abuse, any kind of a abuse, child. Good neglect, you know, has, like this person being a victim of some sort of break of trust, like such tests. You know you were raped by your father or your uncle, or your neighbor, someone that you were supposed to trust.
and when that person was supposed to give you a off, and then, all of a sudden, the crime, you know, perpetrated a crime against you. So that does it happen? Because if that happen, the justice, the judge has to kind of calibrate the the sentence a little bit
so like this idea to do that. He came from a Royal Commission that happened in Canada. Okay, in the nineties. And so people like especially people who steady prison. They were like, okay, Hopefully, now, this is gonna help us to kind of not only decline
the amount of people who are incarcerated, but also decline the number of indigenous. They share of indigenous people, but it doesn't help people. It did not help. Okay, so
like this author of this paper that you don't have to read. But i'm just sharing this paper with you, Jackson. He he can. I agree with him like a 100. He goes like
this: 718 section of our criminal code is really smart, really. Good
people should like you know you you. Your personal life has to be taken to account
when you are analyzing your crimes. However, this is too late in the game. By the time that you are sentenced
that is too late for someone to actually take into account. If you are a victim of hatred, abuse, break of trust, you know some sort of crime. It's too late.
so people need to kind of give you a break or or kind of, you know. Go easy on you earlier on, not when you are about to be sentenced, because that's to like the game, and and and so and what he is good. Oh, another problem that we have
that! He also said that hold on. I just move this thing, because sometimes the zoom stuff gets in my in my face here, so I can see my slides so anyways.
So he was like saying that all. Another thing that we have in Canada, and not every country has that when you're gonna be sentenced to like during trial, let's suppose you commit a crime. You're gonna be sentenced like people like the usually the probation, or usually the the the some some correctional
officer like not like, sometimes like usually probation officers or some officer in court in some, some jurisdiction is the police. It depends a little bit, but someone is gonna write a report on you. So it's gonna say. Okay, Marcella queued someone. However, you know, Marcella has always been a very nice person, very kind, very sharing, very devoted to the community. So like that report is actually
brought into court, and that, like the like, the judge before the judge sentence, someone, the judge reads those reports. Okay. So so those reports. The reason why we have them in Canada is because again it it it. It was about trying to kind of get our incarceration rates down, and also trying to get, like
you know, decline the share of indigenous people in prison.
However, that doesn't work people? No, no, none of those measures are working. None of that is working
and and and just so, you know a lot of those reports they ask. I'm gonna like, you know again. Let's suppose that I I am like, you know. Again, the person who is going to jail, or who is gonna be sentenced, and then let's suppose Matthew is writing a report on me, and Matthew is interviewing me to write that report, and then, or interviewing someone from my community. And then and then, Matthew, let's suppose that Matthew, you know, like his police person or someone. You know the the criminal justice system.
And in the the questionnaires that math is going to use. Obviously this is not Matthews option. It's like the system, so like they. They. They have criteria inside of kitchennaires that you know. People apply to, you know, like math would apply to my my family or to me, and then they would ask me.
Marcella, do you have a hobby? And then I would say, let's suppose i'm indigenous.
Not really this idea of hobby. It's kind of a Western European kind of you know it it now. It is everywhere in the world. Everybody has a hobby, but it's not really, you know it's. I don't really have a hobby, because I mean, you know, my indigenous. I I mean to indigenous traditions. We don't have like fishing for us. It's not a hobby. Fishing for us is like a way of living hunting for me as an indigenous woman. For example, it's not like, you know, a hobby. It isn't a way of living.
so I mean, and it's so funny, because for you guys because you are all from Canada. Most of you, when you speak English like naturally like hobby for you, is something that you take for granted that oh, everybody has a hobby.
and in in no like. Actually, when I first learned English, one of the first chapters in my book is, Hi, how are you? The second chapter is, do you have a hobby? And then you learn, you know, skating, ski all those words that for me they're for they're like aliens. I mean that doesn't belong in my world, especially in Brazil, like skiing no snow. No, you know ice skating. No, you know, anyways, but like why, i'm saying that because those reports that they're going to assess, if you are a good or a bad person.
they ask you, do you have a hobby? And if you'll say, oh, yes, I have a hobby that counts good points for you. But if I say no, I don't have a hobby that counts against me. So this is just one example of how those reports that are actually used in courts. They have buyers against, you know.
people especially
indigenous people, and people who are in general who are not part of this.
who are from other cultures where, you know, like certain things are not valued, or certain things doesn't really exist. Do you guys understand what I'm trying to say here, or this is 80 into you or like, because i'm trying to take you away from your culture right now, and kind of think critically about, you know. So in this people, those reports and those surveys that people use to my my math example.
you know, like it's using against me like, okay, I'm gonna apply the survey to, you know. Give Marcella, you know, to classify her if she's you know a nice person or a bad person, a high risk offender, or a low risk of better. That doesn't stick to me. You know
that doesn't that that doesn't capture, you know, like this stuff that that I do, and that I stuff. And I don't do anyways and look in the report People is surveillance.
the report, a survey. If i'm going to use a survey against Matthew, or against Greer, or against Joey or against anyone in this course that is surveillance, because I'm going to be collecting data on you and say, okay, Greer, do you do you know, do you have a hobby? Okay, Yes or No, I'm: i'm gathering data.
It's surveillance. Okay. So anyways. so greedy. Oh, by the way, I agree or got in here. Okay, interesting. Okay, you guys, are are you guys following me? If you're not, just let me know.
please.
again. So the problem. So we tried. Section 718, didn't all work. We tried reports did not work, you know. Okay.
I'll put forward to this guy here which I really like him. Actually, i'd like to meet this person. I'm going to check Where? In which universe this this person is, and the to kind of connect. So Mate Jackson says the problem lies in policing.
and and it goes back to exactly what Alice like her, or does like her like her work or not. That's the point
that she raised, you know. And and so the thing is that we look. Look at what this is like, actually, Jackson saying we should. I mean it's me paraphrasing him. We must shift the focus.
you know. like
you know, to the following gatekeepers: what me, what to Jackson calls gatekeepers is actually Police Bay of Courts. If we want to
those, you know the amount of people in prison. That's where we need to act, because sentencing too late in the game, you know. So again, as I told you. You know X. We have extra judicial measures, which is just like a warning and a referral to to program, and we have a extra judicial judicial sanction.
so measure and sanction. So again, just like I told you you're across your jay walking, and I see you, Jay, walking drunk on. Why, if I am a a police person.
I can give you a measure, or I can give you a sanction, you know, and you quite often. You know the police people. They know the people in the community, they know. Oh, I've seen you before. I've arrest you before, so they also get kind of fed up
because they see people like, and then eventually, so you know, a sanction, a sanction, another sanction, and that sanction builds into your hag record someone I can't remember who was someone came with a very smart comment question, less at the end of last class, saying, yeah, Marcella, but sometimes those sanctions you they they expire.
Indeed they expire. I went to check that so like depending on the like, you have a timeframe for you that they can apply in court. So let's suppose that you know Marcella has a lot of sanctions, but it's been like 10 years, so those sanctions they cannot be used against me, you know, in my profiling in court, so the judge will not be able to look back and say, oh, Marcella, you you did a lot of like crazy things when you were you when you were a juvenile, and and and now you know you, you continued in that
pathway. No, because you know there is a expiration time for that. However, however, we're gonna see this in another article.
That that is in this course is that I mean now with police. We have big data.
so like my information, even though it cannot be used in court, is stored somewhere out there in the police system, and the police person can still use it against me, like which profile
we all. There she comes again, that woman again. She's drunk, and she's Jay walking. I am going to look her up, you know. And then you look me up in your system and you're gonna find. You know my my sanctions from 10 years ago. And then there you guide your behavior, and that will make you more likely to give me another sanction instead of giving me a measure.
and though you know
I was sober, sober for 5 years, and then today was the only day that I had a kind of you know. I I couldn't help, and I and I drunk again. Right? So so, anyway. So we have to act in here. And, Marcel, how can we act in here? It's training people, a police training.
and that goes back to Alice on this article, too. How can we have it goes back to this brutality. It goes back to the videos that I placed for you on the class. I mean, if you're going there, you're gonna see that I put the videos for you in there. They one that's really crazy about Brazil. I put some like, like, you know. I said something about strong content or something. So be careful. If you don't want to see stuff, don't don't watch that because it has kind of it doesn't show anybody being killed. But it shows blood, and
but that is the worst ever case of police brutality in Brazil, where there was another one. But like that, one was kind of marked in a collective way, like, you know, a bunch of of police people they didn't know what they call operations in one favela, which is the equivalent of Aguero, and they killed 26 people brutally.
They murdered 26 people, and and anyways. So so we have to change training and obviously punishment
for people who don't fall the rules, I mean right like for police people who don't follow the rules. So
so bail courts people the same situation they accords again. I just want to say I won't spend too much time here, but I just want to give you one example. one of the conditions. Let's suppose you You know there is. There is a suggestion. There is some evidence that you commit the crime.
and then you are arrested. You are in remand. Remand is the prison for people who are not sentenced to yet. That's how we call Remand here in Canada we call Remand. So you are in Remand. Let's suppose you are sitting here in the Remand in Edmonton, and then, because, you know, like there is a special that you queue someone.
and then
I come in there to bail you out. And one of the conditions that the judge is gonna ask me is like Marcella, do you? Can you be responsible for that person.
you know? Can you
be economically responsible for this person? In the meantime, can you shelter this person? Can you do you have an address? Do you have a home? You have a residential property where you're gonna be sheltering that person, you know. Do you have a job of your own that you know. How is your life?
Because for me to vouch for someone I need to have a pristine kind of life. I need to have a job I need to have, you know, some sort of like a. You know. I cannot have a record myself. I mean, I have to be, you know, some one of of good reputation. But the problem is again: Put yourself in your shoes of people who were like, you know, went up in prison, or who are, you know, like a like being held under suspicion, I mean as a suspect. So I mean again, if you are, let's suppose indigenous people.
people and your parents were in prison, and you grew up like, If your aunt, your uncle, then eventually you end up in foster care, and then foster care again, and then
and you you you you know you age out, and then you didn't have a job, and then you didn't have any connection. And then you actually worked small jobs. But you couldn't make ends meet, and then you were asleep in someone's couch, and you don't really have a connection, except for you know, people who are not very nice
people. Are you going to be? Or is the judge going to bail You give you bail? No. you're going to say no like you. You don't have anybody to vouch for you. Anybody who has a good reputation, and again a good reputation.
according
to European standards. It's not like, you know. Oh, I have an uncle who lives out in the reserve.
He doesn't really have a house. He has a trailer, and what he does for food is like he hunts and he fishes.
You know he kind of has a very traditional lifestyle. Get my uncle coming here and bail me out. No, because the court we apply the same criteria that they apply in the kitchen air. They're going to go like do you have a hobby? I mean.
You're not gonna ask that, but they're gonna do you have a job? And the uncle is gonna say, Well, yeah, I I I have. I i'm a homemaker, a fish I hunt. I have my, you know. I leave out in the reserve, and I also get some money from the Government.
No. they just certainly the judge's gonna say no. So and again. But let's suppose now that you are. You are, Marcella, you know.
And then that's what it's me, and I am in jail, and then I call. I don't really have like family in Canada except for my spouse. But let's suppose I have a lot of friends in Canada. Let's suppose I call Dr. Hagery, for example.
who was my Mentor with my mentor, who was my supervisor and the Phd program. You know, with someone that I like a lot. And I asked, Look! Could you vouch for me. Certainly he would bail me out and look and look at the kinds of connections that I have. I'm not even a Canadian.
But I can get, you know, good connection. So this guy, you know, makes lots of money has is a profit that you've a very high reputation professor of criminology. If he goes Bail me out, I mean, certainly the J. The Judge gonna say, okay, she's gonna leave with you in your basement. Great. So it's fine. I'm gonna let her go, you know.
so
so that I i'm not talking about immigrants here, but it makes life harder for immigrants to especially low income Immigrants right like that. Don't have a lot of connections, or even like you know, immigrants. Don't have connections right? So so anyways.
So this is bio courts, and then the other part that I want to talk to you guys is
Oh, you have to move this thing again
sometimes. Zoom
gets in the middle of my face here so I can't. I can't see what's going on.
Okay, now, I can see so probation officers the same thing. I mean, if you are released on probation.
That means that you, or if you have a suspended sentence, I mean, or if you are doing sentence, but not in prison, you always have to check in with the probation officer, and again the probation officer. It's not up to them to decide. Oh, I like Marcel so much. I'm going to take care of her. No; they also have questionnaires that
like surveys and those kitchen, they're extremely old people.
They're very old again. They They were made, you know, at least 50 to 60 years ago. They they all. They're all very old, and and they have very a lot of bias against people who are not
like the traditional European people, regardless. If you are a white or not, like the European lifestyle. so like for you to be to get a good score. You need to have that European lifestyle which not everybody has right. So in particular, the indigenous people they don't have that so?
So anyways, so in like the stuff that they look for is like your type of a F of all offense. Obviously education, employment, family, your family circumstance. Again.
you know, if all. If you tell a probation officer or my uncle is in prison, my my grandfather is in prison to my mother just came out of prison. My sister, you know she's not in prison, but she she was victimized. I mean
that that counts against you, you know.
Sentence principles again, dear, favoring non indigenous youth. So let me just go back in here. This is the sentence principle
principals. So this is interesting because I wanna like here. This is what's kind of made to help with indigenous people.
but in the end is helping the non indigenous people. because the the like, like the whole criminal justice system. when they see a juvenile, a a person who is youth.
and and they they do not have nearly like their life, was dysfunctional. They come from dysfunctional family, but it's not like a situation where their parents were raped. They were right. No, it's like, you know.
was a hard life, you know, dysfunctional family that the daddy drinking the money drinking to you know that kind of stuff like, you know, in and out of school, like the judges. They look at that, and they applied this to that kid with they should, they should, they should not, saying that they should not.
But but you in the end, when we look at the stats, it's benefiting much more non indigenous kids than because we still have that bias against indigenous people.
you know. So, anyways, this is all to tell you that I mean
this is on policing, so that we need to kind of. You know the gatekeepers is the problem like policing bail ports, no probation officers. And and even like, if we're gonna go
beyond the gatekeepers back to sentencing
that sentencing principle is now working for, for, as they should; and as a consequence, what is the situation? The share of indigenous people in prison is just increasing. It has been increasing, and we will continue to increase. Because, as I told you, you know, indigenous people in digital sched in this country, 40%
all of them are in poverty people, if you need. If you if I say something in class or this is interesting, I want to see the data. I have plenty of much to just see shoot me an email, and I send you the reports for stuff, you know, because sometimes you're writing something for your prof or for someone else. You know you want to know
people. Is that okay? I mean, did you guys follow me? Because I am kind of like excited about this excited in a bad way? I'm a kind of that topic kind of. you know.
Are you guys? There it is, Natasha. It's extremely upsetting. When you kind of get again.
I can confess to you. I was one of those people that I was like. No, you know. No, it's like. Come on! You are in prison, you know. You got up like me. I was kind of like that, not like, you know, he an idiot, because obviously i'm sociologist. I know I know social problems, but I was like, now that i'm working with this topic.
It's just like my goodness, this is just hopeless. I mean. you know.
Yeah, so let me. It's okay. Let's move to the next topic.
Okay. So here we're going to continue talking about policing. Okay. And we're going to go back to more kind of policing policing. So
okay, so let me just get this stuff out again.
Okay, people. So look, we have one article
by this person called Andrew Goatsmith. and this is about well listings
who listens new visibility.
which is pretty much the idea I mean, I the I just kind of weird for my taste, but it's like it's about visibility and policing. Okay, so let's go. Let's go in there. So look, this is the Guy
Andrew, and he is in Australia. Okay, he's in Flinders University of Flinders University in Australia. And this
article that I'm. Asked you to read was published in the British Journal of Criminology. Another very good Journal. Okay, so let's see what he has to say. So let's first. I'm going to give you the starting point. So look, we live in a society people. And now I mean again, probably
just like the hobby thing you guys take for granted because you were born. Probably I I don't know you were like what? What? 2020 something! It might be 2021, or you know, between
weing and playing something right. So that means that we are in 2 2,02423. So you you guys were born to 2,000 right like so you
like for for you like probably all of you here in this class. I mean it's maybe there's some exceptions. But for most of you you were brought up in this generation where you were kind of you when you were born.
like Youtube was already there. Okay, let me let me actually do this. I don't know your aids, but well probably you're gonna give up your age if you feel feel free not to tell me, but like, in case you can tell me I mean like you did you guys? I mean, Did you guys like when you grow up? Did you guys already have Facebook and Instagram and Youtube? That kind of social media stuff or not yet?
Let's see what people are saying. Yes, okay. So yeah, Sarah says, Yes. Okay. So probably you know, more or less kind of thing. So yeah, so you kind of, you know.
Okay, Greer. No, okay. So Grier, you you understand very much here where i'm coming from right when I say society was not like that people now you know it's like at a point that I mean
anyone can be filming you like like secretly
and sending something, you know you know it. They could like it could be stupid. It could be like, you know you're sitting at the airport, and then someone is feeling you because they like your outfit, I mean, you know. And then they're sending that to your friends on on social media. So like society changed so much with like social media and technologies, I mean when I was a kid, I mean.
you know we would kind of. We would be kind of I don't know if agree or kind of I don't think you are, I mean because I'm i'm 10 years older than you almost.
but like for us, I was born in the era where we had to kind of take pictures, and we had to. I don't even know the name in English like develop the picture. How we say that agree, or like when you you know you would get that stuff the film and you would send it to a shop develop. Okay. So we had to develop that people, and that cost money, and it wasn't that, cheap as it is today, so people were kind of really agree. Or was that was true for you, but for me it was like, you know. We would kind of, you know, save kind of no don't like Don't.
so we would kind of take features that were like real pictures, not just like. Take stupid features all the time, because, you know, I mean for one your your film would, and the films people. They would come if they at 2412, 24, and 32 pictures only. I don't know if you guys even know what i'm talking about. So you know.
Yeah, the field was very, very expensive. So we gave you 24 pictures, or 32 pictures, or or or whatever, you know. And exactly so.
People society was very different today. Everybody has an like smartphone you can take like B. Jillian pictures. All you need to do is just find some space to save and you can film you can, you know. So that is the starting point. So think think with me
this new society change it, policing.
It changed the police, like, you know, like the way that the police departments, the police people. It changed completely.
because before even for even us. I mean, I did things when I was like young that that.
thank God, there was no cameras, because, you know, if people would, you know, take a picture of of me and put on the Internet. You know, that would get myself. Not nothing serious. But I I would. You know I would kind of get in travel, in the sense that people would laugh at me. They would like I would. I would go like I would become a search. Some sort of man on on the Internet. You guys get get what I'm saying, like, you know. So that time was really much. I mean, I I believe that was much better, because I mean, you know you didn't have so much control in society. Now, you anyone could be
feeling me. Anyone could be recording me anyone could be taking a shot of me a a picture of me, you know, like, yeah. So you know. And that's the thing. I mean, everybody, all of us, you know, would be considered deviant kids if you know we could be photographed right like, anyway. So look
like this article here by Andrew. He talks about 2 cases that we had. Okay, and he used those case to explain how like, you know, technologies and media, social media and technology, how that change policing and the police. Okay.
So the first case that he talks about is, it happened in 2,007 in Canada, actually in Vancouver. So this guy here named Robert. Let me remember how to pronounce his. He was a I think he was a Ukrainian immigrant
in Canada, and he didn't really have like the right paper, Strand or Canada. So Robert
J. J. Kinski, I think that's how Jakowski how that's how you read his name. So this guy here, Robert, you know he he flew into Vancouver, you know he didn't really have the the proper paper work to clean, to clean the customs like to, you know, to enter the country, and then, you know, he start to get like, you know, the police kind of took him for investigation on a separate room. He start to get very agitated, very kind of impatient, and also afraid. And obviously he's probably his mental health.
I was not there very much so anyways. But the point is like the guy. He actually he was like the police was a daiser.
Yeah, that's what the police did to him like. They days are him like many times, many, many times.
and he had a hard to talk, and he died. Okay, so.
And then there was a like another Canadian person who actually saw the scene.
That was a person who had to this Canadian personal was that that happened late in the evening in Vancouver, at the airport, and this Canadian person wasn't there because this guy was sleeping at the airport. Take a flight in the next day, very, very early morning.
So kind of our, you know, early bird, or even like a red eye kind of flight. So and that Guy Taser, Robert, and he died. No, no, the police stays or him. So it was a case of police.
at least did not know how to handle him instead of kind of you know, like just I don't know. Calm him. Somehow they tasered, and then the guy died, and then someone saw, and they reported that.
And and then this person who recorded the Canadian person who wasn't there waiting for a flight. So
the film to the newspaper, and then it became a huge, huge, huge scandal, one of our Most High. Like historically speaking, one of the most high profile cases of police brutality in Canada, one of them. And and so this is the first case. The second case that that the Andrew uses in the article is about Ian
Tom Tamilson. I don't know how to say this name. Here, Tom Tom, Tom, listen. So this guy here
he was a a guy who was selling newspapers in London, and there was a big meeting in 2,009.
Do you know when I say G 20. Do you guys know what it? What that is? Like all the richest economies in the world, all the the Presidents and premiers and leaders of the 20 richest countries. They were gathering in London in 2,009, and this guy was selling newspapers, and then there was a commotion. There was like a protest. There was like a lot of things going on, because, you know, people like like unhappy for unemployment, and happy with all sorts of things they were protesting, and then the police came very, very.
very strong on the prot protesters in London, and this guy he was trying to get out to get out of that crowd.
and because he was selling newspapers, and it's like, you know, I can't sell anything here anymore. You know. It's getting too dangerous. He was trying to get out, and then and then, like the police kind of use the button to hit him, you know, in the stomach.
and and he kind of walked to kind of a few more blocks, or, like, you know, a little bit more. And then eventually he fell down.
and because he had some internal bleeding, you know, in his stomach, I mean, you know. And and later there was a huge inquest on his into his death. and he he did. He did have a problems deliver, like, maybe, from alcoholism or something, but regardless they they hold the root cause
was, you know the the police brutality. So they became very, very famous. So why they offer Andrew is using those true cases because
he's trying to say, Look, this is a new era where, you know those cases are even much, much, much more common, right? Because now the police does surveillance on us. But we also
do police do surveillance on the police? Right? We do that all the time. I like even like we feel, think about those recent deaths that we had in the United States, I mean, you know
they someone was fuming right, and all that mature was admitted to courts to the trial. I mean. So a lot of, you know. I probably. You guys saw all of those. You know those videos. You know exactly what i'm talking about. So Andrew calls the surveillance that we have now like, not the police surveilling us, but us doing surveillance on the police. He calls that so
so, surveillance. Okay. So is that is a French word that means under. like, you know, in French. It is under so like surveillance I mean the guys is he's not a French speaker, but like he, you know, use that French term. So that's what I have at the bottom here for you. Surveillance surveillance. So it's like when someone is actually feeling the police. So you know
well it can be name kind of context. But in this articles the police, so it's like the recording of an activity by a participant that is, in the activity. And this is quite common. This became the normal. The first thing that we do when we see something wrong is just to pull the cell phone right? So so anyways, let me just to the chat before
before I move on.
Oh, okay, Great. Okay. You remember those cases, right like. Yeah, I remember I don't the Canadian one. I never. I learned about the
Canada, but the the one in England. I I I read in the newspaper, and I was like, I can't believe this, you know.
Yeah, it happy continues to happen again. It's training people. Nothing has been done for police training. So anyways, so now you got you get the set up. You get where you know. So this person is trying to understand how policing change it, because now we have surveillance. So how does it? I mean, obviously, that changes policing, right like
And okay, so look
some important ideas that you offer discusses, and I I actually appreciate. I think this is actually interesting stuff for us to think so. Today's police people. the like Think about, admit the police. The other day I was walking on on White Ev, and I was thinking about this text.
and I was. I stopped with scar on my app, and I was like, oh, there there you go! There you are! I mean it's obvious. Again we take for granted
that that the police now is identifiable. We take it for granted. But he hasn't always been like this. If we look historically. Police used to be like holy, say in English, like when it's like a
it's not like in in in in clothing that are a plane called. You know how they got. How do you guys call that? Help me here in the chat, like, you know. Let's see someone undercover or clinical. Yeah, Exactly. So Police people. Most of the police officers in the past.
They were under cover or playing clothes. You would not know that they were, you know.
So of course, we always had. Like modern police. Modern police
is visible, but we like. We always had a huge chunk of undercover. Now we don't have that so much, because especially because we have cameras, so we don't need that anymore, but like, but not it's much more obvious. Okay. So today's police is visible. It is identifiable, and that means that means that they have to keep
like they have to have proper behavior at all times.
So it's not very easy to be a police officer, because again.
all of us humans, we are a little bit deviant. We do even things. But if if you are, you know, like it is just like, you know, like all of us, we perform right like this. Like sociologist I called. We have a lot of theories discussing how we perform, so we perform. So when you're working, you are performing. You have like, you know, like me, I I am teaching so I have my teaching outfit, I mean. I don't come in here with my like, you know, like home outfit. You know what I mean. Like we all as we perform.
and and you know we perform on the job we perform at school. We perform in the family we can we performing in in family gatherings like Think about Christmas or Easter, you know you have. Oh, i'm gonna have to meet that people. So you kind of, you know, Say, there's always someone in your family that you don't like, so you perform right like oh, I are you? You don't really care. You don't want to know, but like you know, so we perform. That's what social life is, but for police you work 12 h shifts, and you are very visible. So you have to be very careful with what you're doing, because
any and everything can be used against you, so it can be very tiring, you know, and it is I mean, it is exhausting. I mean to some extent so
so they in the way that we population we view the police, it reflects on their accountability. So if I see the police kind of you know, you know. Oh, this is Canada, not so much, but in Brazil police people they take advantage of of businesses.
and they go in there for free food. They go in there because nobody is going to charge. And this is Brazil. I don't i'm actually on with Canada's like that, you guys tell me. But in Brazil I mean, if you are a police person
I mean, you know, and you I go. Let's suppose I have a bakery, and you go to my bakery. You are a police police woman, and you tell. I like you all Great brand I was like, oh, have some? I'm not gonna charge you because it it is my best interest to have
you. And also this is like, you know, and also some a lot of police people are corrupt, so they they want to take advantage of that. I don't know if they do that so much in Canada, but anyways, but that I mean when I see a police person
in Brazil having coffee at a bakery, because in in Brazil and Baker is they also sell coffee.
So you know, having coffee there, or you know, eating there immediately. My brain goes like, Hmm. Is this corruption? Is this, or are they taking advantage of the business person? Or you know, I mean immediately, I think about their accountability, right? Like how comfortable they can. They explain this action because accountability is about your ability to explain the action when they say, oh, i'm going to hold you accountable. It means you must be able to explain yourself in case it comes down to that right like. So
So, anyway. So how we feel them reflect on the accountability right like. So
so please let me to now is look very militarized compared to yeah. True.
Yes, you're right. And you and again, Matthew, in your right to in Brazil. They are, I mean, I still like I I I agree with you because
in Brazil, in my country, announced, okay, Brazil, let me let me go the country by country. The police is just like in the Uk. Probably it's like less militarized, and we have more undercarved cover. Police
in China, you it's very rare that you see a police person or a police car very rare and doesn't mean that they are not there. No, it means that they are kind of old school. They are like, you know they are not identifiable. So what I am saying this article
it applies mostly for we rich countries. But even like we have to be careful because we do have some variation. Okay, we have. We have some variation.
a place. I work at this I have. Okay, Have they have discounts. Okay, yeah. But I have discounted one thing, right like, yeah, but I I hear you. But I don't think in Canada is like as likely as it gets in Brazil people taking advantage.
Yes, Jessica, exactly that. So this this
you know.
so
surveillance he has to do with this
like media media communication, you know, globalization of, like, you know, information has with that. Okay.
let me just see the other part of your question, Jessica, since not people in Canada are all knowledgeable to on the extent, please, we go.
Yeah, you're right. You're right, you know. So anyways, so police people now, because I mean because of communications, as you put Jessica, because I like what? Because of the stuff that you're seeing there in the chat I mean
police. Now they are very much influenced by what happens in the world, not only here, but anywhere. So you know, case of this brutality in the United States, because we all communicate, and we all have that access to that information. It looks bad on our police.
It looks bad. You you get like it, just like what you say, Like whatever is happening to world.
it looks bad on on other other police. Get to get influenced by that. Our view of the police gets influenced by that. A lot of the cases. The worst case that I've seen of police brutality that I personally have heard or seen
they didn't happen in Canada, but that those cases they they do influence the way that I see the police people in everywhere in the world. Not only Canada. Right? So it's like, so it's you can't disconnect in you more. And so, people
visibility.
This is a very important thing. Look, take take a note of this 1 2 3, this third because i'm gonna ask them. The exam in the final exam visibility used to be mostly primary.
just like when you and I. We were kids.
People would see with the eye, and that was it. And that would become memory like memory in the brain.
right like the crazy things that kids would do that time would become memory. So that's called primary visibility
today. What we have is secondary visibility. It is like, you know, through the publication of photos, media, etc., etc. So, Jessica, what you mentioned
in the chat here, you know like this. Let's see where you put it
rise of global communication. Yes, you're right. And how do we call that? It's secondary visibility, so that rise in global communication
that gave birth to secondary visibility. Because now I take a picture of you and I circulate that everywhere, right like.
So, anyways, what is the problem with that? The problem with that is that
secondary visibility, does not
it doesn't come with context? It doesn't it doesn't come with context. i'll give you an example. There is this woman what's her name? Andy Andy, boy? Oh, geez, I forgot her name, though.
And the you guys help me, i'm gonna tell this story. And you Google.
So this woman. I'm very kind of I I actually I think i'm gonna write to her. You know she's in prison in the United States. So this woman she was a police officer in Minneapolis.
Missouri, or you know it was I mean, or Minnesota, Minneapolis, so I can't remember now. I think it was my Minnesota. True, you know. Anyways, this woman something.
I can't remember the woman I can't remember to see it in the catch. Remember the name. I'll tell you this story. So this woman she was. She had a traffic light. She had a
a traffic stop, so she she and her companion, like her partner at work. They stopped a vehicle in the United States and the guy the guy. I think I think I did not want to stop and and eventually stop. But he had a good Anyways, I can't remember details, details like.
but the point is, she got a taser, and I think I mentioned this in class. She got like the gun out of her, you know, like about. And she thought she got again. But she thought that she was getting the taser.
Okay.
And then she said to the guy, days or days, or days, or like, I'm gonna take you. You said 3 times, and then the guy wouldn't like, you know, comply whatever. And then, you know. And then she actually pays her him. But she was not tasering him. She shot him
so, and then she got. She got like the prosecution. Winter went, went for
first degree murder, and then they drop down to second degree martyr, and I think that she is going to be sent to her. She was sentenced that that all happened last year, like the the trial at the very end of last year. I think she was sent us for manslaughter when you queue without the intention of killing.
and and I kind of that case I mean. Now I I don't have the keys in my mind anymore, because I deal with too much stuff, and I can. You know I should have revised that one. But like
I can, I don't have the details anymore in my mind. But when I was following that case and I read, I felt very sorry for her, and you, you know you can see people in court right like She was like crying her eye off. She was like desperate. She was like oh, my gosh! What did I do. I took someone she was like
she was like devastated. You could tell you you truly, honestly, could tell that she she was not like. Oh, i'm gonna shot this guy. No, she wasn't a a terrible mistake.
but still a mistake that took someone. Someone's life, and you know, and and they're they're gonna be repercussions right like. And but she, you know. But with the part that nobody knows, I mean.
that was brought to the court case. She was working people 12 h she she was. Her shift was 12 h. but because of short staffing with the police in the area where she was, she was actually doubling. She was like working sometimes 24 h shift. She was working like No, we felt the rest.
and people when you are without rest. I don't know if you ever, if you have, if you have ever been in a situation where you are totally, totally, completely sleep deprived.
You get crazy crazy when I say crazy like you. You do things that you don't even remember that you did it like you like sleep is a real thing, and that's why my research.
I. You know the research that I do with correctional officers. I have. I work with Phoenician psychologists, and we do have a psychometrics in there to measure sleep disorder, because that's a real thing, because those guys are always short stuffed, and they are, you know, lieutenant or their boss. Whoever is. The boss asked for them to do double shift, you know. So that is just like, Obviously, eventually, something bad is gonna happen, and that was her case. But again.
Sorry, you know, right like, but I I feel like kind of writing to her. I think I will do that. I'm gonna write to her in prison, because I mean
I kind of you know, kind of give that compassion, because I mean. And then obviously the guy was black, you know, that became another layer of problems. She was white, so it became races, and then she swears. No, it was not. But again. But then, you know, it became a whole
Perry situation. But anyway, she's in prison. Yeah. Kim Porter: Thank you so much. Matthew Kim Porter: You guys can Google her. You can see her story. Okay.
So why i'm saying this, I I told you this story for for Kim Porter, because just to showcase how secondary visibility it takes away context.
Everybody saw through her body camera that she shot the guy. Everybody saw the scene of her shooting the person.
but nobody saw that she, you know she was like
she had this, like, you know, like she was not sleeping for like working like for the last 2 weeks. She was, like, you know, doing double shifts. Nobody saw that.
And again, is that an excuse? Obviously not. But this is something that needs to be accounted for, and even like, in my opinion, the people within the police organization. They have to be held accountable for that, too.
It's not just her. Because, again, that problem is not like wanting to feature a problem that any police officer working in in such a situation they are much more prone to make mistakes and see the stupid mistakes like this one the next, then actually can get someone killed. So I think that you know people at the police department they should be held accountable. But ask if they're gonna have if they were held accountable. Obviously not.
She was alone. She had to face this alone, right like anyways.
the bottom line here people. Is that because the police, now they know before you should be the police watches the police.
They are the surveillance agents now
police. There's 2 surveillance agents, but we members of the public. We also became surveillance agents.
so they, the police, now needs to deal with that.
So it that changed the whole game. I remember that I have someone who did their bachelor's degree in Media
here. This person has already has a a lot of work experience with me.
It's taking the course I mean, think about.
I mean you now, the police they need to think about media they need to think about. You know. Police is no longer just like, you know. I'm gonna arrest someone. I'm gonna take care of public safety. No. Now police became. You also need to have public relations. You also need to have a public relations office. You need to know some. You need to hire people who are going to monitor your image on the social media, because
that's that speaks to how people see you and your legitimacy as law enforcement. So to be police Today it's much harder than than it was back in the days, you know.
Oh, Marcella, this is much better, because people cannot get away with with abuse. Obviously I. Of course we have to find the views.
but it's also much more stressful, because people they can be caught in the context can be removed right? So so the bottom line here that is here. So visibility became a site of regulation or a site of management, so something that the police needs to manage. They need to balance that being a good cut
or police officer, and also being kind of dirty workers, because nobody wants to know about the police, and in society sees them as like dirty, almost right, like. So they have to balance that that status, and they have to do it
in the media in a very visible way, you know.
and they have to regulate their front and back. Marcella, what the heck is, front and back. This actually is the those are sociological concepts front back that comes from golf. Irving golfman.
Alice's father. Okay, and because what he says that in society all of us we perform.
So right now I am performing. I'm teaching you. That's one thing. But i'm also performing the role of a professor. So that means that I You know I have to dress up properly. I cannot say certain words. I have to be carefully far, I say, and I don't say the same for you guys. You are playing the student role right now, so you can't just like you know you. You have to kind of, you know, like there's something that you gotta do for you to be in that role. So in in our role we have the front and we have the back.
So the front stage for a teacher is what's happening right now. It's me with this kind of outfit. No, my hair kind of organized. Well, my hair is easy to organize, but, like you know, it's all kind of you know, put together. My backstage is me, you know, in my you know, domestic kind of outfits where nobody sees it. I mean it's just like you know me kind of, you know, like eating here by my computer and then doing my papers and preparing my lectures. That's the backstage. You guys don't get to see the backstage.
I don't get to see your backstage when you come to me to talk to me, or all put together. You know proper language, you know I don't get to see. So like, you know, we all pick, play roles, so the police they also need to manage and regulate very well their front stage and their backstage. Right? So
let's see here what Matthew has for me. Okay, so
hold on a second. You not believe that the footage was would be released.
So what would you say? This shows in regards to the police a portrait of first or trainee, Matthew for me, I mean again, when I see all those cases of police brutality
I I know I mean I don't my heart with off. Obviously I I feel like you know, that emotion.
you know, in my heart and my stomach in my you know in me I feel that emotion
and like anger, you know, like this should never happen.
but because now I kind of see the back door of how policing happens and how correction happens.
What goes in My, I don't blame them. I blame their boss like I like. Sometimes I have those crazy dreams that I I mean of. Obviously they they have to be prison. Hey? Let's establish that, in my opinion, or they I mean they have to be sentenced, or they have to be tried and sent in any duty sent us any prison, but like what what kind of yourks me and in in kind of you know he kind of makes me mad.
is that it's training for Christ's sake. It's train. It's recruitment. We have a huge problem with training recruit. I see it as an occupational problem. Obviously.
obviously, if you want analyze from a psychology perspective. someone
who bits up someone and is laughing. That person has problems. I don't. If you agree with me, I mean, you know, if you see someone being tortured.
and you are like oh, you know you're being tortured. I mean that problem. That person is not very good in mental health. That meant that that person, you know, has a compromise kind of mental health. That person is not very, you know.
and and so the psycholog, and obviously that needs to be sorted out. But me as a site call as a sociologist. I think about recruiting recruitment
training.
I mean, why we are not training Don't. We first. Why, we are hiring.
There's so like to think today, society we can. We can put people on the moon
we can select, we can, we can sort and and classify and select, and we can sort students first law school for grad school. For you know, we have all those strategies to to select.
and I understand that we keep selecting sometimes stupid people, but like, but we have all sorts of strategies to select people. and then we have all sorts of strategies to train people.
So when I see a police officer doing brutality, I mean, I go like
I the you. You should be fired. You should be, you know, investigated, prosecuted, probably sentenced, probably in prison. But more than that, I what is going on with the police department?
What is going on? If they are training. How did you? How did you end up in there?
How did you? How did the like? If you know anything about my enforcement? Well, maybe you don't know. But let me tell you, they are occupational. The work environment in prison in police is super toxic
It's terrible. It's a it's a very hyper masculine kind of environment where men they gotta kind of, you know, be brutal that you know it's just like horrible for people. Everybody suffers. But if you don't buy into that. You become the victim. You're gonna be bullied. I don't know if you guys followed what happened
with like
Edmonton institution, you know, if you if you guys Google right now, Edminton Institution staff abuse, you're gonna find
Edmonton Institution. Of all the prisons in Canada is the worst one we have had correctional officers raping correctional officers. We have had their correctional officers assaulting correctional officers. It's just like brutal. It's like the worst
W. The worst. I mean all prisons. They have terrible environment, admin institution. It deserves like, you know, the Oscar for that I mean it's just like
It's it's it's the worst.
And I mean, how? Why, corrections. You know the deputies I did the Ward and the Deputy Commissioner, I mean, why those people allow this to continue.
I want to see those people in prison. You know what I mean, like. you know. So, anyways, let me see, Matthew here. I like Matthew. Do I make sense to you. Is that what you meant?
And see here, people we are Almost I can leave Time is up.
Can I just answer this very quick, Jessica? What about case where they're where they're backstage is in direct contribution. If the job
Yeah. And and you can't. And that's the thing, too. Jessic. I mean new Nazi, I mean, you know I mean not not like Nazi ideology killed
6 million people plus isn't that enough. How how are we like again? It's part of the screening.
It's generally in it's part of the screen, and in the training, I can tell you. Jessica, the training for police
and correctional officers in Canada. I'm. I'm. Very familiar with those trainings, I mean for for police in Ontario and for correctional officers. Federal. I don't know all the trains I know, for a Federal police officers for Federal correctional officers and for police people in Ontario. Their training doesn't talk about like, you know, like
like like you know X extra extreme ideologies. It doesn't it doesn't teach them those things which is a it's a huge problem.
and that's where we need to change, You know I mean. So we don't have like, you know, an officer, and it should be
train on that. They need to know. They need to know that you know what Nazis means and what that meant. Historically, they need to know, you know, indigenous people, and they need to know exactly that culture or those cultures, what they are about and how they work. You know what I mean. Like it's, you know.
Canada is a country where 25% of the people They are immigrants, police people. They need to be trained on that.
you know, like, but they're not. They are not, you know. So let me suggest that here. My mom used to be provincial. Yeah. So some of the storage tells me my stuff. Yeah. So in Jessica your mom can tell you about the training as her like. How was your training? What kind of contents did you have.
you know? Ask her, and ask her opinions about if the training was actually helpful. And you probably you're gonna hear. At least that's what I have. I hear my interviews that the trainings. They were never helpful to teach people anything, you know. It's just like it's a mess. It's like, you know
people. Thank you so much. I have to stop here because that time is up. But anyways, we are catching up. So this is good, and I have some space and the syllables it's good. We're gonna make it. So thank you so much. You guys take care of yourself.
I came pumped today because, like this stop, and i'll come, you know, because I have more to say. So, you know. So thank you so much. And you guys take care. Okay. stay safe.
Let me just stop here if you need anything to stand the line. But Thank you so much.
You, too, Jessica. Thank you so much, all of you, Jenna Selena, Natasha, Nicole.

Mar 21

"Hello, everybody! Welcome back to our surveillance class.
I see. Here we are saying, Marcella, where we are. The answers i'm gonna make sure that the system shows you. I I thought that I did that, but i'm gonna Probably I did not. So i'm gonna triple check that all the exams they have, you know, because I have. I'm working with multiple exams like, you know, accommodations. You know different kinds of exams.
So i'm gonna make sure that all of them. They show the correct answer. Okay, people.
Yeah, I think I think there. But i'm gonna double check because I You know you kind of check the boxes like you. You go okay, show the questions, show the wrong question. Show the right question, you know, like you know, I and I checked everything. But i'm going to triple check
people. Welcome back. I'm happy to see you.
Okay. So first of all, I would like to say i'd like to share with you. That. I mean, we'll tell you that next on Tuesday i'm going to have to pre record the Class so I'm going to pre-record this class this Saturday
Sunday morning.
and then I am gonna put it only class for you, because I will be not the seminar the whole day on Tuesday. So I won't be able to, you know, to be with you.
It's actually I need to do. I need to triple check.
You know you know what strike that because i'm not sure if I'm gonna be. If my thing is gonna be on Monday or Tuesday, I have to triple check. So if it is on Tuesday. I'm: You know. I'm gonna send you guys an email saying, you know. Hello, people. Tuesday. You know it's going to be a pre recorded class. Okay, I'll let you know.
Okay. So another thing that I want to share with you guys very quickly, because he has to do with the the stuff that we're gonna discuss today. Let me just go in here and share my screen. I want to share something with you. I don't know. If you guys.
I don't know if you're following the media, how much you are following the media. Let me just share very quick this thing, this actually this is not the lecture that we're gonna do it just yet.
Do you guys see my screen like? Do you see my my powerpoint? Or you see something else?
Okay, Great. Okay. So very quick. I'm: Just let's just go here at the beginning of this far point set. I'm gonna i'm going to share with you this thing. The first thing is, I went to Rbc. Like
Like to the actual store, like for shop, or whatever branch that's the name branch to update some of my information in there.
and I had a very quick chat with the analysts. Whatever you want to call the the customer. You know this: the the person who takes care of customers at Rbc. On White. So I went in there.
and and we work a cheese check. We are like chatting like me and the person. And then the guy told me that that when you know, whenever there is a like, whenever your account gets involved with some sort of scam or fraud, or anything suspicious.
especially if it's something big. I mean it's a big thing, not like a small, suspicious, like something big
like, and then they go, and they check. And indeed
you were kind of, you know, like a victim of a of scam, or, you know, a victim of fraud. I mean, what they do is they flag your account forever.
And this it speaks to what we are. We're going to discuss.
We discussed a little bit. I remember that I we thought I talked a little bit. I can't remember the person's name, I think, was Rise. You know someone else like how you know the police kind of stores like keep this like they do storage. I mean, they keep them the the data from things that they cannot really use in court anymore, but they still store the data
the same things like with banks. I mean, you know, I mean, you haven't done anything wrong. I mean, you are actually a victim. But you know, at the end of the day it is your account that gets flagged, because, you know, you are a potential risk to the bank right like, even though you are a victim. The bank sees you as a as a risk.
So I really appreciate that that information, and, like I don't have to tell you that that information paid my the time that I spent at waiting at the bank to to update my information, and whatever my account in there, and I I thought that you guys would like to to know this. You know.
Another thing that I want to share with you
is okay. So you see, my my Powerpoint, like you see, the blue and green stuff in there, right like. Okay. So the other thing that I want to share with you. I don't know. If you guys, I don't know if you are, how much you know about what's going on. You know, in the world right now, because everybody's
believe something. But like there there was, like, you know, Tramp Trump is like tramp, the former Us. President. He is involved crazy things. And one of those crazy things is this potential indictment in New York because
he paid like, actually, the the reason why is that, like he, he! He lied in in allegedly. He lied in, you know, like on on the way that he spent his campaign funds. So it seems that he use some some sort of campaign funds
to to pay Hush! Money to to, you know, to a woman who allegedly like you know, had has had sex with him over the telephone, whatever that it's a long story. But to make it shorter, so the problem is not really, you know, like the sex with a woman whatever. The problem is that, you know, is the campaign account
right? So, anyways, and then trump. He now has his own social media platform, and he went in there, and he said he asked his supporters to protest today because he thought that today he would be arrested, or you know there was maybe a gossip or a rumor, or whatever that was.
But the the interesting part is that.
you know, Trump called people to protest, and in Florida, indeed, there are some people, you know, protesting outside of Mara Lago, which is this like mentioned where he lives.
But what I found really interesting, and also has to reflect the one of the what several true, at least 2 of the articles that we are discussing
is that, like the State, like all over the United States, all the all the States in the Us. And all the seeds the big cities they called they are playing calls police to actually dress in uniform today. So you know. So, for example, where, where, where did you get this? I follow BBC news.
Excuse me. and and this is a print of my phone, and I saw this thing when it was like it was like today. I was like like today in the morning, or something. Oh, well, here it says an hour ago, but because but it was published today, you know. So I think, was actually
or is it was it yesterday? I can't remember. It was either yesterday or today, so I I I immediately thought of you folks so like all my people there, they're gonna appreciate this thing.
So look at this. So there is this whole, you know thing about, like, you know, like the protest. And then look at what it says in here every member of the Nypd, you know, including plain cloth.
you know detectives, you know they should be their order to where their full uniform. So, people, this speaks to what what we discussed last class about police, modern police being visible.
It's the so called Visibility of police, which is it's a kind of it's. It's a double edge sword, because on on one side you know
it like anything can like be captured, and anything can become a problem, any. In many cases it's it's very good because you get abusive law law enforcement and police officers. But on the flip side things they also can be like portrayed outside of context.
and that becomes extremely stressful for law enforcement. If you are put yourself in the shoes of a police officer, so it can be extremely stressful, because you know. I mean for you to explain that that's not what it looks like on camera, because, like the camera is just like, you know, like a a cut right like it's just like
part of the reality. It's really hard. So anyways, I thought about this, and I thought, okay, probably this is like this is like a live example of like, how you know this stuff that we are reading, how that applies to society. Right? So let me just see. Valencia says.
Oh, Valencia is talking about the bank here. Oh, oh, I did look if I can see. I don't know I would have to do research on that because one of the things that we're going to discuss today, Valencia, is that the the empirical ways, the actual material ways, the empirical ways of how surveillance.
There's very limited research on it. That's the reality, and we're going to discuss that today in one of the articles. But so I don't know exactly. But what I know
is that the banks they do share data. I know that. So I know that you know one bank can see how good of a client. You are in the other bank so, and I won't be too surprised if they can see that you are flagged, that you are a risk customer. I'll let Jessica go on, please.
in terms of the bank. Could we maybe argue that like to some degree you have a form of privacy, but the second you risk.
because if you have like, if you get stand basically you could potentially risk the privacy and safety of the other people in the bank. So by getting scanned, you're basically for fitting your right to that privacy in order to protect more privacy. If that makes sense.
I mean, you know their their grounds. For I mean you, Could we, using the the law that we have in Canada right now, or actually the law that's about to be approved. In Canada we we could file a lawsuit against the bank for sharing information.
We could. However, you know the problem is.
who has that money right like to file a lawsuit against Rbc. I mean very few people in that
have that kind of money. Second, when we open up a bank account, I mean we have. I don't know. If you remember, when you open up your big account we have to check all sorts of like there they give us the default a standard kind of contract for that service, and it's like huge
and tiny and obviously people. Don't read that kind of stuff, and you need to check the boxes and sign in there somewhere the banks. They say that they share their their information like with the central bank with all their banks. They say that. So? So that means that if you file a lawsuit against them, you know it would be.
You would be like, you know. They would argue they would take that against you, and probably you're gonna lose. But there, there's a lot of problem to what you're saying. I totally understand, and from. But your argument is is really like it. It it it's really good sound, but that's exactly what the bank argues right like. So that's
from the bank perspective. You are completely right. I mean, you know at the moment that you become a subject of fraud, a victim. You are compromising the entire security system, and therefore it's almost like I have the right to, you know, actually actually Jessica.
Now that i'm going over here, and like we're talking, the law. Actually, the the new law that's gonna pass in Canada actually has a loophole that allows organizations to collect and collect information and share information if
it is to protect you.
So probably again, if you find a lawsuit against the I'm. Just thinking here out loud, and you know, if you file a lawsuit against the government you're going to lose on many accounts like the first one. Is that you sign that document, that contract. Second, you know there is a loophole that says, where there is a you know, like a language in the law that says that you know, if it is to protect you, I can share and collect data.
you know there, of course, limitations on that, but I still can share and collect. So so I I see you, you you're very right. I mean? That's that's the rational behind
anything else you want to comment.
Let's see here.
So for Lance and here another thing. I mean, okay. So it's Selena. Now I mean after the White House riots. It makes sense as yes, exactly. But what it's interesting. Salin is not even that that they are calling people, but it's like
It's asking them to put their uniform, you know it's like be visible. It essentially what like you know in Ypd. L. A. Pd. You know, like like you, you know. Everywhere there' be visible like, because, you know, we want you. We want
to be visible at this moment right so and and so again in the past the rationale would be different, like, you know, 50, 60, 70 years ago the rationale would be, you know.
more like, you know, like plain cloth people on the street like. No, now it's the opposite. So
so anyways the point of comments or anything you want to add before we go back to this I'm going to share right now.
I found when I read I was like, oh, this is like super interesting. Let me you know until if you guys, I think the same way that I mean. i'm trying to kind of show you and call this things like, actually translate to reality right, like the stuff that we were discussing. So look
last class we were talking about. We were still at splitting one. and we were talking about Andrea's article. Okay, so. And we were here. We talked about like, how like now we have social media. And then one important thing. We talked about 2 cases like one Guy Ukrainian guy who came to Canada and in, and he got like a teaser, and he he killed if he was killed by police action.
So we talked about those 2 events, and we talked about how now we have so
surveillance. So is a French word. It means under like, okay, under the right radar, so it's like almost like surveillance. So now we police. They do surveillance on us, and we do surveillance back on them in both case. Here they were captured by someone and and filmed and taped and and sold to the newspapers, and then they became a huge kind of like
travel for the police right like. And again in this case, obviously, in both cases the police acted with brutality. Right? So in those people they they should be punished.
But there are also cases where you know it's like it's not really it's. It's stopped that if you put it out of context, it looks brutality. But if you put in a contacts, it's kind of on the edge of being okay or okay, right? So. But in those 2 cases here we're talking about.
But the whole point of this article is like it's kind of to to understand how this hyper visibility that police has today, how that influence is listening, and I I recall that I told you that it's almost like police departments. Now they have to hire someone specially to do their media relations and and respond and act on and react to that hyper surveillance. And then just I want to emphasize something here that i'm gonna i'm gonna ask on the exam the final one.
So in like back in the eighties, nineties before
the cell phone, like the smartphone, what the kinds of surveillance that we had, like the kinds of visibility that we had was called primary.
And this is here in this slide, right primary. So it's something that you see, and then that's it. I mean you can't really, you know you can't really publicize because you don't have a tape. But now, with like, you know, we being able to report everything our Facebook being able to do like lives and Youtube lives we can. You know what we have now is secondary visibility, because we not only tape that, but that gets immediately spread all over the world. I recall a few weeks ago
I go. I saw date.
or I didn't see the thing, but I saw in the newspaper that an airplane that that fall in in Nepal, I think I think, was Nepal, and like in the person a person who from England, who was traveling to Nepal actually, when when he saw that the airplane was kind of shaky, and and everything was like getting in a emergency situation.
He pulled up a live on Youtube, and he actually broadcast.
you know, default, live, and then obviously everybody died. So so even that Guy died. But like this is crazy. I was like My goodness! Look at how you know where, like, you know, secondary visibility. Guess I mean to the point that you are broadcasting an airplane going down with you inside, right like it's just like, or or you know we have a lot of a very sad case. Many very sad cases
of teams committing or dying from suicide, live on on on social media. Right? So so it's another another problem, right like another example of how like like of how secondary visibility gets out there. So imagine for the police. This, like this is changing society, and if you are law enforcement that changes you. And by the way, we talked a little bit about training last class.
and I told you that the police they're not prepared for that. They're not. Their training is not caught up with the reality of visibility in today's world. Not yet. Okay. And the same applies to. I can't. I told you that I cannot say for for holding to all the police officers in the country, because
they they go through different trainings. But I can speak for the police departments in Ontario, where I do research in there with them. So I know fairly well their circumstances, I mean I more familiar with
I'm not very familiar with the admin them situation here, but but I can tell that they're they're not trained to to do with that, and people put yourself in the shoes of a police officer or law enforcement probation officer, correctional officer, a police officer, detective, I mean anyone, you know. So it's extremely stressful, extremely stressful.
You know that I mean, if you can see you know what I mean. Again. Of course there are crazy people everywhere, and and also very poorly trained, and people who are not good professionals everywhere, including in the police, unfortunately, but the majority of the people that we we have in the forces.
They are. They're
people who actually care about. They're doing a lot of them. They do a criminal, criminal, justice, degree a criminal knowledge degree. And then they go find a job in law enforcement. So it's people who took a course like mine like our course here right so they know that I mean they're not in there to abuse people. On the contrary, they are in there because they want to change the world in my research with correctional officers like like like. When I ask them, why did you choose this occupation to work in prison? They say, because I wanna like first is payment because
it pays well. It's a job. It's a stable job, and the second reason that they give me is, you know, I really want to change the world, and when I look at the make up 80% of those folks working prison a lot of them. We will switch to police. They are there just kind of making time, so we can switch to police
a lot of them. They about 80 of them.
They have a postsecondary degree, and and about like 50. It ranges a little bit, but like about 50 of them, they have a university degree and 30 of them. They have a college diploma, so it's like we're not talking about. We're talking about people who actually care about criminal justice. Right? So so anyways, so it's. I'm staying all of that, because for you to imagine how stressful it is when you have to work under hyper
surveillance like this like this hyper visibility right all the time. So so let me see. So I set kind of set this last class. I just see the chat here.
Joyce is contributing here.
Exactly. Joy it! That's exactly what you describe, Joy Joyce describing here. Like you know it becomes, and then it becomes self surveillance. So that external, like, you know, secondary visibility.
it translates into self surveillance, which translates into hyper alertness which translates into Ptsd. I don't know, I think I told you guys in this class
that you well, I shared with you that I do research with law enforcement, right, and especially if correctional officers. But I also do with police. So my research with law enforcement I I I like.
I start to kind of realize from the interviews that I do
that people are on edge. They tell me when I ask about your stressors, you know. Oh, I am all the time on edge, You know. I I think I mentioned this here right like I go home, and and i'm thinking about work, and i'm always on edge, and i'm walking on the streets, and i'm watching people's hands. I'm watching people's shoelace if they you know, if they can run or not, I am, you know. I go in a restaurant. I want to see if my back behind the wall, so I can scan the environment. It's almost like you become you as a law enforcement person, a public safety personnel, you become
a surveillance camera like you become the camera. You embody that mentality right like you start to kind of be hyper alert, and the literature on psychology. And I think we have some psychologists here in the room today. The literature in psychology. It says that hyper alertness
to be on edge.
It's a symptom of Ptsd. That's like 99, 5, 98% of the literature says that. So if you have Ptsd meaning panic attacks from from some trauma, you're gonna develop that hyper alertness. And because your adrenaline is going to be always off right off meaning too much.
so it's not going to be balanced.
But I' after interviewing those folks, and they they didn't have a diagnosis for Ptsd, because in my research. You know we, I say we because it's more people, not just me. I'm not a clinical person, but we do have clinical people, and we assess law enforcement for their for Ptsd.
And a lot of the people that don't have. Ptsd. But they have the hyper alertness. They They they are always on edge. They are always, you know. They say I'm on edge. My guard is always up, you know. I never put down my card. I mean those are the expressions that they use when they're talking about their stressors.
And and then I start to kind of read more about Ptsd and read more about being hyper alert. Actually. there are few papers out there. I feel research out there that they say that a hyper alertness
can now so lead to the development of Ptsd.
you know, so it can lead you to kind of.
you know, to like it's not really Ptsd, but the symptoms of Ptsd can in making it can give you a panic, attack. It's almost like it. It it like it creates some sort of unbalanced in terms of your hormones in the brain, and then you are. You know it, Trigger. You get very easily triggered, and and that it becomes a huge problem in daily life, right? So so Anyways, i'm telling you that just because
quite often, when we go to a course that is kind of embedded in criminal justice, which is the case of a surveillance course.
I mean, we talk a lot about the people being surveilled.
but we don't talk a lot about the people who survey okay, and in my interest as a researcher enjoy, I still have to get back to you. My interest as a researcher is
on the on the organizational side. It's like on. How, how surveillance happens, you know, behind the doors, and how you know and and and how like the people who do surveillance, how do they experience that, because not easy, either, you know, to to be a surveillance agent is, it can be extremely hard, and it can take a toll on your mental health, right? So so anyways.
So. The big argument in this paper is that conditions of choice.
and i'm using here the same language of the the paper conditions of choice. He means, I mean, it's funny because the person wrote in a concluded way like it. What con conditions of
2 police departments and and personnel have been eroded. What what? What this author, Andrew Stripes tell us is that, like the ways in which the police makes choice, change it.
and he could be much more clear, you know, even though I mean you know I mean he's a native speaker in English. He wasn't very clear. His point is, you know, like
like the way that police people have make choices on the ground has changed. It has changed because of the visibility that they have. They have
right. So they know that that camera that footage is going to be on the Internet. Like in in a matter of like hours, you know. So that is extremely. You know that it's on the personal level, stressful on the organizational level. It requires more skill in managing
like how the police is perceived by the population. Because, again, the whole legitimacy of the police has to do with how we, citizens, civilians, how we see them
if we start to believe that they are all corrupt abusers, you know, who like to spread their in society. I mean, we are gonna we are not going to trust the police right that that's problematic, because we still need the police.
Right? So what do we do when someone breaks and enter your apartment or your home? You call the police. You know you. You expect the police to come. What happens when you know someone who you know your loved one is victimized. Sexual assaults out murder. I mean you expect the police to catch that person.
and to find who is responsible for that right like that violence. So so, anyway, so
But the police is lagging behind people.
Exactly. Just Jenna, exactly that, you know. So you know you can. I mean it destroys you right like, and then well, I didn't, I didn't tell you. But since you Jenna, put that comment on the box on the chat box here, i'm gonna say something
when we look people at all the occupations in society, and I have date on that, you know I like. And this is actually the heart of my research. When we look at all the occupations in society
like law enforcement occupations.
They they are the ones that screen the worst. They have the the highest numbers for Ptsd
general excited disorder, suicide, suicide, ideation, Ptsd. General Anxiety, disorder, suicide, suicide, radiation, depression. So they they have the in, and they have the worst scores.
And when we. This is law enforcement. But if you want to rank
correctional officers is the worst, the worst of the worst.
And then second comes police officers, and then it comes like others like paramedics and firefighters. And and after that it comes nurses. Okay.
so like, you know. So imagine, I mean, so we're talking about. And we again, we don't want to hear about that, because we we believe the way we seem to like. Okay, I don't want to have. You know those folks law enforcement they have to do with like
criminality. They do dirty work. That's how we see it. There. You work.
and you know they represent the people from a society that I don't want to have nothing to do with. So I don't want to hear about that. That's how we as society. How we behave right? So.
anyways. Another thing is that another point that that they make, you know, is that I mean
like like No, they they this idea like that, You know, normal policing you used to use to be used to mean just like you know you perform according to you know, whatever values of a society like every society has its own values.
So if you want to be a seen as a good police person, all you have to do is just to perform. But the problem is that with hyper
visibility, or what Thumpson Thompson is not the author, but it is the the author that who Andrew, the author of this this journal article, Andrew uses a lot, thumbs up. And and this Id about, like you know, like
primary visibility, secondary visibility actually comes from Thompson, one of he talks a lot about that in his scholarship, but anyways. So the problem here is that it's like to be to go by. The the values of a society is no longer enough.
That's not enough anymore, you know you have to. You know what you have to do. Now you have to be extremely careful, because any and everything can be taken out of contact, or even in and everything that sometimes we say stupid things, people, all of us. We we say stupid things. So if I
to scrutinize your past your last 10 years of life, and I could scrutinize all your interactions with your colleagues and families, and and because
i'm sure I would find enough material in there to to destroy your reputation. I'm sure right, because all of the every human. They say things that sometimes they don't even mean.
but they just say just because they want to belong in the group, or because you know that sounds right, or because, you know, they were actually in an idiot, or just because, you know, they want to belong, or whatever that is, or or for because of ignorance. They say we say things that you know, but the thing is that those things they can be captured now, right like in that can be, you know.
So so here, I mean, this is another very interesting concept.
Thompson. He talks about that in this context of new visibility we have what he calls disruptive disclosures. disruptive disclosures. What the heck is this? It is those little moments where you don't really mean.
But you said something extremely stupid, or something that's extremely wrong, according to today's social rules. And that became, you know.
that became
like that that becomes broadcast everywhere, and that kind of subvert this idea of you as a normal, proper police person.
Right so, and all of us. And we're talking to contact Here is the police.
Agreed, agreed, agreed Greer. They should, and they because they represent, look. Greers Comment here is extremely important. Law Enforcement officers should
should be held to a higher standard of behavior, they sure they should, they should. And the reason why they should is that they represent the State people.
You have to remember that law enforcement. They represent the law. They represent the State. So that means we are going back to training. That makes me even more pissed. When I look at training, you know, for, like the
police officers especially because I know that training like my my hand, I know that extremely well, and I I am extremely like like unhappy, with like the training that they receive is just awful. It's just awful. It doesn't prepare them for anything it doesn't teach them about indigenous people. It doesn't. Teach them about it Doesn't teach anything.
you know, and and then you know it Doesn't teach them about mental health, the mental health of inmates.
and a large chunk of our inmates. They have mental health problems. Imagine you sign up to be a police officer. Okay, You're, happy. You're gonna be making $78,000 a year. You're gonna have patient benefits. You are. You are happy, but you don't really you you won't realize you don't realize that you're going to be actually, you know.
like taking care of people like. Take literally people literally taking people off the rope.
Imagine put yourself in that shoes, you know, taking people like, you know, providing first response to people who are who do like crazy self. Her i'm not talking about slashing. I'm talking about like
crazy self harms. We have some histories inside of Csc. The Federal correctional system of people who do brutal self harm that it's. It's it's so bad that I, you know. The other day my boss called me saying ourselves, we're going to do research with people who do self harm there's like
at the psychiatric facility. In Saskatchewan there is one specific, the inmate or resident, who is always on the media, and and the need is terrible. They put images of of her like of what happens to her body after self harming. It's just like it's so like it's kind of
I like when my boss called me and said, we're gonna do a research about about like the experience of having to provide care and support and in custody to people who to those kinds of self harm, extreme self harness.
I said, No, i'm not doing that, because
this one case that I actually know very well because I interviewed an officer about it. He gives me people. He gives me it triggers My! When I talk about it. If I talk about in detail, it triggers my emotions. It takes me off. My, You know my
normal kind of range of of you know I get triggered so you know I can't. I can't do research on that. Imagine.
you know, if you are an officer and you when you go through training, nobody tells you that you're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to actually provide care to that person. So it's. It's extremely hard. You don't have to prep for that right. So
so in in and so anyways, agree or so. Your comment makes me get even more pissed about the training, because I mean, you know those people they need. They need special training. I mean, you can't just like, you know. Go, you know, 6 months in an academy, and then you become an officer, you know you can't. We cannot have that, you know anymore
or any longer.
Let me see Jessica here
Exactly.
Exactly. And, Jessica, you're very right. And and I actually made a note here. I have you here. I wrote Neil Nazi, my, you know, because I think what you you mentioned about like.
And again, I mean, you have to screen people right like. You can't have people like you have to find that their tools today's world to screen people and make sure that you're gonna You're not gonna be hiring people who are racist if you promote like, you know, racist ideologies, I mean, you have to kind of be, you know.
Yeah. So yeah, so anyways, so, people. So so it it's the whole problem, you know.
Any anyways, we could. We could talk more about. We need to move so. But look, this is disruptive, more disclosures. Think of them as those little moment, little little stupid things again. Obviously we go from the range here to spectrums. Huge. It goes all the way from police brutality, like a police officer
using their boots to, you know, to kill a black person all the way from that or in Brazil. We just had another another situation in Brazil last year, where police people they got a guide like a traffic. I mean. They
like the guy was like like he was on a motorbike, and they stopped him, you know, to see his documents, because he suspected the guy was looked. Look at this. The guy looked too poor to be driving such a fancy motorbike. So they they stopped him.
and then and then the guy didn't have the documents for that, you know. So you know the police officers. They did bias against him, but in the end there was something in there. The guy did not have the the thing. But look at what happened After that the guy reacted to being arrested or like there was discussion, and they would arrest a guy.
Look at what the police officers in Brazil they did. They put the guy inside of the car, the police vehicle, and they guessed the car like. Do you know those like bones that they use, and protesters they they they use one bomb, they close all the windows of the car, and they guessed the person
like
this is like
like, for that was for police people.
and our my President at the time, who, by the way, is best friends with Trump
in some other folks in the world like like he's not in Florida. By the way, the President, the former president of Brazil, this guy he did not want. He he didn't want to, You know he he! He like he! He! He ordered the police in the state
where that happened not to investigate. and in now that the presence is gone. Now the investigation is.
you know, is actually happening. And and now there is a chance that those people are going to be actually sentenced where you are convicted, you know. Can you guys imagine this? I mean, this is like I've never seen. I think this of all the worst case of police that I've seen in my life. This one in Northeast Brazil scores the highest, I mean.
anyways, people. So
yeah, no, Bosonaro, the President. He was, he was in perfect alignment. He was like, oh, yeah, the guy didn't have a license. He deserve it. I was like
what I mean. This is just like my boy.
I mean does. Well.
yeah.
like you're talking about. Do tear what's his name to Turkey to where I think right like his name? What's his name? Again? People: the former. Yeah, let me just see here. Yeah. So that's him. Yeah, exactly Another another. By the way, I don't. I don't understand what's wrong with those folks. Honestly, yeah, do territory. Yeah. So don't understand what's wrong with those people. I mean, you know, I mean, one thing is like you politically. The is one thing
you be, whatever you want to be, conservative, Liberal, whatever you are, but like
this is beyond right like. Now, political ideologies is getting like mingled with like criminality. Almost so.
You know it's just like.
anyways. So people so here disruptive disclosures. They make us miserable. Miserable. Again. It goes the whole spectrum. It can go from
horrible police brutality like the stuff that i'm. Sc. Script describing for you all the way to stupid things that you said that someone recorded that you don't even mean. But you got you in a hell a lot of travel right like that You regret, and you truly from your heart. You regret you don't even think that way right like. So it goes all the spectrum right so like.
But to think about it. It can be extremely extremely stressful. And how do we? And here's something that I was thinking about when I was reading the article? How do we measure
disruptive disclosures. There is a way to quantify that people. and the way to quantify is right here.
Oh, sorry it's here. It's social medium.
you know. We call I mean, like if you say something, or if some like all the stupid things that we see on the Internet in today's world, I mean, you know they they they those things, those disruptive, I mean. Again, we're talking about like technology and surveillance and media. Right? So that's why the whole lecture started with this slide here.
Where is it like here? So we are talking about that. So you know. So how do you know you know? How do we, you know, here is where we actually feel the whole thing
in all. You know, a lot of people are are bashing me on the Internet. A lot of people are, you know, or like him, or or otherwise. Right? So that's where you actually see the effects of of disclosure. So you see our whatever being viewed by millions of people, or or being disliked, or you know to the point that sometimes it gets it gets flipped to like you get. You know you, you'd say people they, instead of being like
fair or kind of being like, okay. Now, this is wrong, and you, you should be, you know, taken to you should be prosecuted. People start to actually
commit crimes against you, like you know, send you frets and all those things right? So you know. So that's where we kind of
yeah in Valencia. I'm very aware of, like India, because I cover, I use. I I read the BBC. And BBC. Every month
covers it. Could they cover a lot of India like BBC. News from England? So, because of the past relationship, Colon colony relationship that they had with India, BBC. Covers, and and again in India it's very, very common when something does something wrong. You know they, you know people would be the whole like village going there, and they just beat the the person up. And I've seen this in Mexico. True in Brazil. I've seen this, but it's not very common yet.
So Mexico's kind of common in this kind of count, and probably okay, let's see what Natasha is saying here.
So.
Oh, yeah. So I see in Natasha talking about Dubai, which is another reality packed with cameras. Yeah, very high tech city, for when it comes to surveillance right and in in Natasha here talking about like, you know, if you are suspect of of selling legal cigarettes, what's gonna happen to you? Probably you're gonna get deported. Actually, Dubai people. It's. I've been there a couple of times because my cousin lived in there. It's a very complicated society, you know, like very, I mean, you know, like Anyways, I I know several stories of.
but I I won't open the the thumb door a box, because otherwise i'm gonna talk about like all the examples that I could, you know.
get from Goodbye. But this is a nice thank you, Natasha. You're very right.
Exactly, and that's that's the that's the worst. Right like. That's you know. And they still. And again, because police has, you know, they represent the state. It's much easier for them to hide right like to kind of
hide things and and make. They have this disappear. And that's another problem. And again I go back to training again. I was like, okay, what kind of people are you recruiting, you know, and and they go back also, not only to training now, but also to management. What kind of people do we have managing the police right like. Well, I I I I have to. I have to tell you this. I won't. Let it see. What time is it.
Oh, I have time. I'll tell you this very quick. Csc. Which is correctional Service, Canada, which is in charge of all the Federal prisons in Canada. They had a very famous case from we that has with a girl called Ashley Smith
and Ashley. She was brutally assassinated by, in my opinion that's what it is me. This is my opinion. Some people might argue otherwise, but, like I see that she was brutally at assassinated by
by the by, the correctional services. It's not even by an officer. It's by the correctional services. Why? Because, like she, she, I mean that's a long story, and it she's a very kind girl who suffered a lot in her life.
You know she got failed by the
just a system in Canada, and and eventually I mean she was a self Harmer, and she would like a wrap, stuff her on her heck, a a neck to choke herself.
and and then she would do that, and then they the like. Well, correction officers. They have a protocol whenever inmate, like, you know, tries to choke themselves or commit suicide right like they. The officers they do have to interfere. So if you do that 100 times the officer has to interfere a 100 times. That's the law. That's the
not the law, but the protocol or the policy. And in this girl. because of a lot of mental health issues, she wasn't, solitary.
and and she had been so there for several months, and obviously she was like totally broken, and and she was, like, you know, trying to kill herself all the time, and eventually
the warden to wardens the big boss right in the prison. The warden at this prison in Ontario said, You know, if she tries again, I don't want you Guys correctional officers to actually respond you. She is just playing with us, Don't respond. Look, that's what the Warden said.
And and then.
like she actually tried one more time, and they did not respond, and she died
so essentially. My view is.
you know it's not even the correctional officers is this system. I mean. It's the warden. I mean. What kind of order is this? Right? So? And then obviously, the whole case lagged forever? There was like 2 inquest in quest is like when you hire a pathologist to explain what happened like how the that person was killed. And anyway, this was like, why i'm saying this because, just like it goes back to what Valence is saying.
You know it was very easy for corrections to kind of, you know. Get away with that because because I mean it's it. It's secret it it. It happens in prison. Nobody Nobody knows what's happening there exactly right so, but any in the end. I mean. First the officers they got charged.
and then later, I mean after the case I mean. They like the charges were dropped because they, the officers and the lawyers for the officers. They They manage to prove
that beyond any doubt that actually that was an order from the Warden. And then my next question is, what happened to the Warden, because this person should be in prison right now, right in my opinion. So what happened to the war? And I think her name was Cindy. Send you something, if I remember correctly. Anyways, this Warden people.
She was laid off Okay. and a year later she was hired again by Csc.
In the department of procurement, not to deal with like residents or inmates or no. She was hired again, and she is currently in Csc. Working for correctional service, Canada, but like in something that has nothing to do. Procurement, I believe. So. It's like.
What is this right? Like Anyways, I mean again, so that visibility is extremely important. So, anyways, the point here is trying to kind of show you that I mean.
you know, like it's like, you know, because it it goes both ways, and it's a complex topic. But if there is something that I can say for sure, for sure is that I mean training needs to be revamped.
and and people need to be held accountable right? And and that's the the example that I gave you in the end, Canada because of the the death of Ashley Smith.
had to propose changes for solitary confinement. So segregation is the actual other name for solitary now is being changed, and it's called now structured intervention units and and but but still it's not. I mean the change that they made, because they came top down as a policy.
There's so many problems with that still. But anyways I mean. But that's another topic. But but I I just want to share with you that you know, in the end, you know, like lack of visibility, and and you know it. It. It resulted in what in in this ward, and who gave that that order being hired again.
so that triggers me true, you know, because it's not a bad bad thing. So people back to the policing. So what when we read this article. So what what does it take home? If you're gonna? If you guys, we work with public safety in the future.
I I don't think we have a lot. But if you're going to be a lawyer, if you're going to be criminal lawyer, or if you decide that you're going to work with public safety policy, or even if you're going to be, you know, a a police officer. If you're going to work for corrections.
you know I have some people here who are very interested in corrections in this class. So if you're gonna work for for law enforcement, you need to know
that policing today be policing by police officers or by correctional officers, because what the work that they do is also policing. But it's inside of jail right like, you know it's just much bigger than than you know. It's much bigger than just surveillance it's because it's hyper. It's managing visibility.
I would say that policing today is is about managing visibility. Right? So you have to constantly manage your image right so, and you have to regulate, and you have to put it oversight in place.
and also look counter surveillance, or call counter so surveillance it does not look good meaning. I mean, what do I mean by that? And let me explain otherwise. You won't make sense of what I mean. What I mean is that, like the the for police officers for for law enforcement, they have
a very hard time, you know, to deal with the surveillance, and also when they, you know, do surveillance back on the side of their little camera that they now have on their. You know their outfit.
That is like it's. It's very, very hard to manage. That's the point here. Actually, I should change this just to kind of it's hard to manage, because you have so surveillance. You have counters to surveillance, so you know it's it's a lot a lot going on.
and if you're going to work with public safety you have to think about.
If you're gonna be an officer, how do you build legitimacy for yourself right as an officer. If you're gonna be like at managing the same, you have to think broadly, how can I? You know, if i'm managing the police department. And that means, and how can I make sure that my police is being held accountable? That my, my, my police people, they are actually, you know they. They have a good reputation that the community will trust them. I mean that those are questions that
that are up. You know what anyone managing police today. They have to think about that right, because it's a much more complex kind of world.
It's extremely yeah, exactly. I mean they they They they're not out. They should not. It's illegal, but they do it right like.
I think so. I think so. Jessica. Jessica is asking here if the concept of locating police funds towards more preventative measure. How would how that work with with surveillance? I think that I mean first educating police officers, so that both doesn't mean because people
this conversation that we are having here.
It doesn't happen in law enforcement.
you know a a. At least I can speak very well for all there. It doesn't happen in law enforcement.
So I think the first thing is okay. We need to. Okay, we need to train them better. That means you need. You need money because it's going to be a much more complex kind of training, and you know also you need. You need. You need a like you need to to create conditions in place for them, to, you know, to be held accountable for investigations to happen inside of the police department, and that also requires, like, you know, hiring people who are kind of external, but but in Karen at the same time, but giving them autonomy, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do that involve surveillance, like
also telling, like disclosing to the population how surveillance is being done by the police, you know by and explain exactly what they are doing. If those tapes, like those, like every police person, has a camera, what like how they're storing that stuff, what they're doing, if I mean, you know, like there is a lot of I mean, especially in communicating to society what is going on in there, you know. So that's where I think that we need to improve a lot a lot. So that trust you will think with me, Jessica. You only can trust
things that you know.
If it looks sketchy, if it looks kind of weird, if it looks kind of secret, you don't trust
right? So it's like, and that's why one of the topics that we discussed in this course is transparency visibility. Right? So it need for you for us to trust. It needs to be visible.
and it doesn't. It does not mean it does not mean that everything is visible. It's legit By the way, fake news on the Internet is the biggest example. I mean, there's a lot of things that they look like. They, you know. They look like
you know they are visible to you. Your eyes. They can see them your ears can hear. But that's made up. I mean that stuff like made up or taken out of context, or you know. So it doesn't mean, but I mean it doesn't mean it's because it's visible. It's going to be legit. But certainly.
when we think about the relationship between law enforcement and and civilians and society we need. We need visibility in this relationship, especially visibility here in the law enforcement, because here we already have
right like we are we Since our civilians, we are under watch, right, and we are being watching. So it was like. So those are things. But you know, if you have anything, feel free to add them. Just switch my Powerpoint talk my Powerpointing. Let me see. What time is it?
Okay, let me get my order one.
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna do now. A police number 2. It's labeled March 20 first. I got rid of the March Sixteenth.
because I mean, I compiled into March 20 first. Okay.
hold on a second.
So this one here. Oh, yeah, it's already Here, Hold on a second. People
share screen. Here.
guys are, are you? Are you folks, Are you guys there? Are you? Do you understand what i'm saying?
Because when I get to excited sometimes I mean, you know.
Okay, Good. You you guys are there? Okay? Okay, am on everybody. Okay. Good. So
okay. So this is like a Powerpoint Number 2. And this is like policing 2. Okay. And this is I already share that with you. So we're going to skip. I shared this with you, so i'm going to skip. So today people in this Powerpoint set
We're gonna we're gonna read this article called Big Data Surveillance. The case of policing it is by Sara okay, brain
folks.
I swear on the what Bible or you know something important, you know I don't know where, but I swear this is an excellent article.
Excellent! It's inspired for people who like like criminal justice, criminology, law, enforcement.
anything of the sort. This is a very well done. She is a great researcher. It's inspiring. She writes clear she's like I don't know if you guys have the time to read that yet, but she is like a rock star. At least I liked her a lot. I like her stuff a lot. Okay.
so it's worth it. I mean, you know, beyond this course, not just for the course, but like with this thing. If you are considering, like
like law, enforcement, occupation, or or all law enforcement, related topics for your occupation with this thing carefully, if you are considering grad school with this thing because it's an example of a very good research. Okay, so she's really good.
So anyways, let's get in there. This is this is Sarah. So this was published in the American Sociological Review again. We already had like something coming from this journal, very big journal, and I put out for you here.
She has a new book about predict prediction and surveillance in case you are interested, you know. Take a look at her book. You can see she has a book that just came up so very, very good scholar. She's solid people, and she's at the University of Texas at Austin, you know, because they have several campuses.
So look, this is the question that she is pursuing. This is the question.
To what extent does the adoption of of big data analytics, change police surveillance.
Okay, so we have police surveillance. And now we have big data analytics.
right? So like not just like surveillance. But like this assemblage of surveillance coming from everywhere, data sets compiled from everywhere, everything pull up together. So that's what we have into this side. So how does that thing called big data analytics change the way that
police departments, police people. So that's what she wants to understand. Okay. And and this actually. it goes back to my example of the bank and the conversation that we had a little bit on the chat about the bank.
What is nice about this research is that she wants to understand, not just like the policy she wants to actually hang out with police people and understand
how they do the surveillance, and how they not only do the surveillance, but how they experience that right? It's really really nice. Look
context for you. She starts off the article, saying, Look, we live now in a society where you know we have.
where, where where we have what she calls technologies a technologically mediated surveillance, so like surveillance. Now
it's not just like me watching you, but as we've been discussing for several weeks now, it is very high tech right like, and but the the key part of this is that now it is surveillance. High tech surveillance is is a part of any kind of organization.
The E. Of a. Has the surveillance on you. I can if I want. I don't look into those things, but if I want I can. I can pull out a report of that will tell me how often you access my my page on e-class.
I can pull out a report that will tell me if you're watching my videos or not, I I can in. I could. I could use that against you. I could say, okay, ha, ha, ha! You had a bad mark. Let me see how you know how many the how. If you actually read this stuff
I could. I could do that right like. So that's kind of you see in many organization people. I don't do those things. I spies that, by the way, you know, but like like in your organization now, you have all sorts of tools
at your disposal that you can, you know you can. It's part of your work routine almost right like. So
so, anyway, so you of it is just the best example because all of us we are in this U of environment. We are being recorded, you know. I I You know you class records. You, I mean, keeps track of it. Keeps like, you know, track of of you folks, you know, like we have Sam technology in the exams. We have log in lock or whatever in the exam. I forgot the name. Now we have all sorts of crazy things to to serve in some people, and if this is all provided by the organization. By the way.
by the way.
there is this new thing that it's coming up. Now about that, you know you asked. I forgot the naming. I I checked that name, and I forget
It's that stuff that you you type a question, and it gives you an essay pretty much, very well written. By the way, you know what is the name of that? I mean.
Yeah, that's exact chat to Gpt: yeah, that's exactly that. So you vain is getting crazy over this, like as a we people who teach the pros and structures, we are getting lots of emails about this and in how you know you. They now the main concern for you. They look at this.
I should share this with you because this is surveillance class. The main concern for the U. Of now is how to patrol you guys, how we, the teachers, how we're going to police. You know how we're going to make sure that you actually roll. That is a and obviously people there is no way to know
right like there is like the reality is, you know you could download whatever from that stuff, and you could change, change, change, and then it becomes, you know, to the point that I mean, how do you track right? So it's very, very hard. And but what I've been mistake that I see that you of a and also other universes are doing is that you're trying to police.
They are trying to, you know, to instead of educate you instead of like, you know, like
you know. Tell you. Look why you're gonna do this, I mean desperation. Okay. But but look, this is not gonna cut anyways, like, instead of kind of like, you know, educate people and and you know, and and and tell them. Look.
we are doing this and this thing so we can, you know. And now no, they're creating what they're doing stat is like they're they're giving me now. They are putting pressure on me. And so I want to say me is like the pros you have to make sure that your students are not using that stuff for your assignments, and also.
you know you have to report them. And now they're creating all sorts of mechanisms for me to report you guys. So I recently the latest thing that I received was, I think, earlier this week or last week was like a Google. Look at how precarious I was like, man, you always just doing it. I am ashamed for them like they they put out like this Google Drive Survey that if I catch anybody
report like of like anybody
cheating, using that chat to cheat, I have to report in that survey. I mean.
I found this I honestly with you. I mean people, people. I just. By the way, I despise lack of integrity.
I despise that. You know this is not who I am.
and I hope that the people who take my course is they. You know they they abide by, you know, like they don't do anything like stupid like this. That's who I am.
and we already have a lot of channels to report academic misconduct. We already have that.
But now there could like just to kind of show off. It's almost like for the managers to see that they're actually doing something about this chat. They're creating new new ways for me to report you.
which is like, and then it gets really precarious because they are doing like surveys on on Google documents. I was like Jeez, this is like, you know it looks bad. I am sometimes. I am ashamed of being an employee, you know, like what? Why you're doing this You have to be. You have to think much bigger than that, because this is just the beginning, right? So you have to tell people You have to let people learn somehow that by doing that
that's not how they're gonna develop their themselves. Professionally they have to think people need to think right like. And and Anyways, do you guys understand what I'm trying to say here?
I don't know if you guys heard about it, I mean, did you receive just i'm curious. Here. Did you receive anything from the of a related to that chat thing? What did you go? Could anybody send it to me?
Okay. So I mean. But did you okay? Did you receive anything official from the U. Of a like official like the you of a send you? No, no, no, no, not a fish. Okay, yeah. Okay. So my thing to you people is
do not do not
use that stuff in my assignment people. because that's the thing. I can see your marks. I can see I can see everything about you so. And that's the thing I mean. If people come up and I see you know that I mean we, you know. Unfortunately, online teaching is a bit different. But once you get to know people, you know how they perform, and then you'll see like those outliers zoom. Something is off here right so like.
Anyways, you want
human, we can. We can see things sometimes that so don't don't use that, and I invite you to kind of think about it. That's not how we you know we make a life like, you know, lack of integrity. It doesn't take you anywhere. They, at least for me. The only thing that I have the only thing that I have here in Canada
is my reputation.
That's how I think about it. I mean it's the only thing that I have. I don't have like. Well, I have my partner, but I don't have family here. I don't have ties here. I don't really. I mean I have friends, but I don't really have anything here. You got. You guys got what i'm saying so, if I the only thing that I have is my reputation. So if I damage that
i'm done, and I invite you guys to think the same way. Try to build a reputation for yourself, and and you know, forget, Don't, Rely on your parents for that, and you build your own reputation in in and never tarnish that with like any kind of misconduct, you know.
Yeah. And actually, Matthew, i'm gonna actually, now that we're talking. I actually forgot when I first heard about this thing, the first thing that came to my mind was, i'm gonna ask this machine how to this? Algorithm how to disappear? You know i'm gonna actually do that. So I can see what it does, you know like how what kind of plan they're gonna come up with, you know. But anyways, back in here, people so
okay, so look
it. So like technologically mediated surveillance, it's part of the I went on this tangent just to tell you show you how this is ingrained in every organization we use the example of of a but i'm sure as hell that you know, if you guys start talking about your workplace. You're gonna give me a lot of service just like you've done already.
right? So so big data, people.
It's like it's like just like an emerging modality, I mean, of our type of surveillance. It's just like one more, and the purpose of big data is classification and prediction. So it classifies you and to predict you. And that's kind of unique, because the traditional surveillance
you can do prediction with traditional surveillance, but like.
but like not to the extent that you can do with big data. And how can we see that in social media, when you know you talk to your partner about like, you know. Oh, I feel like eating chocolate.
And then, you know, like the your computer, Here's your you know, or something. And then you all of a sudden. You know you're getting advertisements for chocolate, right? So it's like. So this is prediction. I mean it's kind of, you know. So it's and also another, and this is something new. That didn't come up in the course. Yet
big data has a feature, and this feature in surveillance studies is called function creep. So I need you guys to remember this because i'm gonna ask the exam function creep. What? What? What the heck is that it gets creepy. Marcella, what do you mean?
This function creep? Is that like you know? That is that the idea? It is an idea. It is a call. It is a concept
that like with big data, you actually gather much, much more data than what actually the purples like. You go beyond the purpose. So you have a purpose. And all of a sudden you're gathering more data that's called Function creep in surveillance studies. So it gets creepy. That's the idea. And I saw I saw. I think also I saw like, because I read newspaper every day like in New York Times, BBC. So I saw a few days ago
that I think it was yesterday. Actually.
I saw something about Meta Matthews Facebook right like the old name I mean. Is it's a company behind for my what's his name, Mark Zuckerberg. So I saw that, like the his share values, is declining.
and I saw that he lost some more money last year, and that this year. He's on this like laying up people off like so he like Facebook and Mada in general. They're They're laying a lot of people off, and so I was reading about that, and I was reading that one of the reasons that he used
to explain to the market why he was laying people off. Is that a lot of most users or not? Most, but a lot of the users who have like an iphone now is like the iphone Apple has some security features in place
that makes it harder for Google and Meta and other platforms to collect data.
And therefore that impacts the advertisement. Because if I don't have the data. If I don't know details about your life, and I am Facebook or I meta, I mean it's harder for me to to sell to advertisement company companies, and for them to advertise in through me for for them to divertize through me. Because, you know, I mean I cannot be as target as I used to be. It it doesn't make sense to you folks. So I saw that, you know, so that caught my attention
because I was like. Oh, look at the function. Creep here. So that means so. If Facebook see if Zoomberg is telling you. Look! Oh, you know my my company did not make as much money as last year, because now you know, iphone changed their safety or security tools. And now, people, i'm not getting as much data as I used to from the users. That means that they were collecting a lot of data that they don't need to, and they were using that for advertisement, right like. So anyways, this is the function creep.
So this is all kind of context for you. Let me just see here
I I try just to see what it says. It says he cannot help you with the criminal. And what is this about Valencia? I I it took me to tell me what? Just give me here. What is the what? What you're talking about here? Because I miss the point. I miss the boat, you know.
Oh, okay, okay? Oh, yeah, You see, that's nice, too. You know. I'm gonna actually put in there because I really want to see what you what it says. And that's one of the things that, like Dr. Hagerty, he was like Marcel. At least keep my my assignment in the way that it is, you know, because you know it's a on the side. It's a very smart assignment.
It's hard for people to to, you know, to cheat. If they decide that they're going to do that, you know.
Let's see. I also remember watching coded by is on Netflix, which is connected to the topic of big data. Oh, yeah, I I watch that. Yeah, by by the way, highly recommended.
Okay, people.
So let's move on. We have 10 min now. So look, look this author for her to answer this question. You know the extent that you know a big data analytics change. At least she went to the
L. A. Police department, so it's like Los Angeles police. And okay, Why? Why did she go there? Because that department in Los Angeles is one of the most advanced in the United States and in the world. So if you want to see police and
policing and big data go there, I mean that's the the place to go and all. And there's a reason right like in California. There's a lot of startups that they do a lot of artificial intelligence, and they have all sorts of startups in there. So it's a very good fertile ground for for big data and for technology supporting big data. So so that helps explain why the Department of police in Los Angeles is so so like advanced, and also they are one of the largest
police departments in the world in the United States and in the world. So they they do a lot of modeling. Okay, like, so that that get them modeling and support like their their like their decision making process. Also it's it's it's a very round. The the way that they do. Police in Los Angeles is very rationalized. It's very rational. Okay.
So let me tell you a little bit of what? The what? The literature? Because there is a big literature on policing and big data. Let me tell you what it says.
Well, actually sorry. There is a big literature on police and policing and surveillance. So this literature he has some problems.
The first problem here is that, like
like the the literature that we have. It's kind of like it's out outdated. They look at Lucy and ectoralism actual.
This is a hard word. It means like, you know, when you compile data it's it's the science of compiling data. So Ak: choral.
whatever you want, you guys are going to put out. However, you're gonna pronounce, but like, but like the the science, I mean, when we look at surveillance and and how police, how the police compiles data.
It's like the the studies that we have. They are very old.
They don't, really. They don't talk about big data. They talk about like old school surveillance. They talk about data sets, but not of this idea of. Like all the data sets integrated, and data flowing from everywhere, everything plug together this assemblage they don't. They Don't cover that. So she was like, okay, I'm gonna cover that.
We also Don't don't really know how big data works empirically.
And that's the point how exactly. If you are an officer, how exactly that helps you, or or or you know, change your choices. Just like to speak to the other article that we just finished. You know. How is it that you know big data changes the way that you make decisions, you know. So.
and also like there's no like research on surveillance agents like when it comes like from the big data perspective.
The research that we have on surveillance agency has to do with like more health.
which kind of more what I do, you know, and and no empirical not or why Don't now right like in China. I do more like this kind of stop. But in Canada
so and there's no empirical knowledge on on how the police classifies people. Because, again, big data is about classification. That's why we had a whole chapter on classification and then prediction.
So that's what you do right like you predict all, Marcella, once chocolate or Marcella, you know she wants to buy a home, or you know. So
yeah, like i'm talking about like the Internet when I get those advertisements like on Youtube or Facebook, or as well. I don't have in stuck in. I don't have I? I only have Youtube, but I know how it works, obviously so. So anyways, and how people are profiled and and classified. Right? So so what? So She spent people 2 and a half years
with the Los Angeles police department 2 and a half years and she interviewed 75 people, and she followed up with 31 people, and she did a lot of like participant observation. So this is another case of ethnographic research.
But it it sounds, I mean, from reading her and also reading. Compare comparing to Alice Goffman this this girl here, Sarah she's much better. In my opinion this is just my opinion. She's you're gonna see when you reach. She reads good. She reads like.
you know it's like you. It takes you like half an hour, and you you get it. And then oh, it's so clear the way she puts it. You know it's so beautiful, I mean I I admired her so, and she also like she. She was like, you know, hanging out with like police people from different units, because, you know, like the police department has several units like, you know, specialized crime, right? Like so just hanging out with them. And
And why? Lapd? Because it is at the forefront of data analytics. Okay? So that's why I should Ch in there. So i'm not going to start.
I'm: gonna stop gonna stop you. This is like, just like a little picture that it is on the article of the you know, real time crime, the center or analysis center. Just so, you guys see how kind of you know how high tech it is.
and it looks like China people. China is exactly like that. Actually, China is the most advanced when it comes to this kind of like big data, and in the because that that that household registration thing that I that I I I give a lecture on that for you guys.
That is like it's the it's the bare back. It's the back, the backbone. Sorry the backbone, but everything is plugged to that household. So, and they have all sorts of things like this.
But but in in in Canada and us, and and the whole Americas, and also, you know Europe, Western Europe, and Continental Europe, Europe. You don't see a lot of high tech stuff like that, You know there is some, but not to the extent that you've seen the Los Angeles Department
So anyways, so before I mean, this is again the question. And then we're going to pick it up from the argument when we when I see you guys again. Okay. So I'm going to stop here. And yeah, and that's it. And i'd like to remember you remind you that we have.
and just take this off.
I would like to remind you that we have off hours. They hold on. People stop sharing so I can see you guys. So yeah, so
that's it. For today. We're going to stop here. Don't want to continue, because I want to break the argument, and then show you the evidence. So come back. Unfortunately, next class, maybe maybe we will be pre-recorded. I'll see I have to see my my calendar.
But if anyways, if it is, I'm gonna show you the tools what they do Exactly. And then later we can catch up in person. See if you have questions or comments, because I've actually i'm sorry that i'll have to do this like if I have to do it pre recorded. I'm gonna be very sorry, because
oh, it's like delightful to see what they are doing in Los Angeles, You know. It's like delightful for someone who is interested in in in surveillance right like Not that I mean as a as a as a civilian, as a seats, and i'm not very happy, but like as a surveillance researcher, i'm delighted. So so, people, that's it for today. So I have office hours. I'm gonna open up right after we finish here, and i'll like to thank you very much. You guys take care of yourselves.
Stay well and oh, hold on! A second. Next class is Thursday.
No, i'm gonna be here. I am people. I'm crazy. I'm gonna be here next class, you know. It's the other week. I'm i'm just going crazy, cool, cool. So look. Thank you so much. Have a nice day. Take care of yourselves.
Yeah, it's crazy.

Mar 23

"Oh, folks, welcome back. Happy to have you folks here.
all of you. Let me see who is here.
Yeah. Nice to see all of you. Okay, you guys are busy on. I can. I can understand I can.
Is my assignment giving you guys too much work, or it's kind of under control.
By the way, I got, I just received 2 emails asking about 2 emails asking about the the the assignment.
So i'm going to reply them. The after class. Okay. it's not too bad, right? Like. Okay, you should not be
so, folks.
I had something to share with you and see what was it.
Okay, yeah, look the most important. I and I truly mean it. This is not like Bs talk.
You guys have to take care of your mental health.
because you know, with this hyper visibility that we have today, and surveillance and visibility, and you know and pressure from society, it's super easy for things to derail.
So you are doing okay on school in school, and then you are doing okay everywhere. And then, all of a sudden, you are having panic attacks so like. So people take care of yourselves. Make sure you are eating well, drinking enough water that you are exercising, that you are. You know that you actually have downtime off the Internet. Okay, off your cell phone, because again, the reality is virtual. But it's also
like here, you know. So enjoy your time with yourself if you, if You' with your families, so you know. So take care of you, because, honestly, life goes by 2 Creek too quick.
It feels like it was yesterday that I was like 20, you know, and and now i'm 40. So like well, 42 going to 43, so it's like things change, and you you'd really need to kind of.
you know, ground yourself and not take, not let society kind of you know. Take you in some sort of wave. You know you guys are not fish to go with the wave. You have to, you know, like
be grounded, and you know, like. So that's it. So look! But I had something else to say, but I forgot what that is right. Now
let me just yeah, no, I think the while I shared with you. I shared with you
like, you know, like last class like about that. You know the police people being called to be to put on uniforms because of because of the potential trump arrest. And and I think that was it. Okay. So let's let's get started. So
last time we met, let me just see here where it is.
It's here.
So let me just project this thing.
Okay, you're good to go. So just to kind of in case you are like lost. Let me just refresh your mind. We are talking about policing, too, and we are here discussing
Sarah's article. Okay, and it's about the La La Pd. The Department of Police in Los Angeles. Okay, and her question her research. She's a She does feel the work. She is an ethnographer. She does qualitative research.
just like Alice Goffman. And her question was, to what extent.
you know, does the adoption of of big data analytics change fully surveillance? And I told you that I really liked her article.
I think we stopped here, or even like.
Yeah, we're we're going to start the arguments. I told you that I really like her article.
That is an example of good work. I don't know if you guys had the chance to take a look, but it's really well written. So you go through there very quickly. It's clear to understand it's easy to understand. Clear it's exactly what a merit call should look like, you know. So she's really good. And another thing
that I wanna say to you about this photo, this image that I have here, this actually I got that from her article. It is in the article, and this is a situation room at Lapd.
and what I would like to tell you is that I mean China people of all the places that I've I know, and and also well, that that I know
China is extremely advanced with big data analytics and policing.
and I kind of gave you guys a little bit when I talked about my research. And I hope you guys to remember I talked about that family Id and I told you that was that was the backbone of China's surveillance system, and I told you, look it like it. It it it's actually a very old kind of surveillance technology. It's a family. Id it's a family passport.
but you know, but all the other surveillance is built on top of that. So you have like data sets linked to that family. Id all sorts of data set, and that becomes big data, and that becomes, you know, that that is used for policing.
So do you guys remember like when I talked about this also? Let me know if you remember. And now, so I I remember that when I taught on I remember that I had a a pre recorded lecture on this actually about China, I think. And
and I asked you guys to go and watch a video of someone of someone like trying to get lost in the city.
and then and then, like that, that, the least kind of found the person d like in in less than 7 min 7 min. Do you guys remember that? Or no.
I would not hear people because this is gonna come up in the final final exam. So you guys remember, Did you guys watch that that video? It's like a a 4 min video, I mean.
Yes, you're saying that you did so. Did you find that incredible like how fast they were, and how like, you know. So okay. So, Sarah, you have to go in there and you have to see it. I'm gonna i'm gonna it's scary. It is. So. So i'm gonna put that that video for you folks
let me. Just Yeah. So I'm: just actually well later, Sarah, i'm gonna put like before we finish. Class. Oh, okay, you know what i'm gonna do. I'm gonna get that video. I'm gonna put it on the class like at at the top of the class. There is like a section with all this stuff that i'm putting there for you guys like, you know, from Media, from the media, etc. So i'm gonna put that video in there at least, Sarah, watch, because
China people is not Canada China. You have like it's extremely populous. It's people, kind of everywhere, and then it takes them like nothing for them to find a person to track down the person like lost. You'd be like you trying to find someone like you know one person in in 7 million people
see, and and you know, and they find it in a matter of I can't remember for 7 min or 9 min, but it's just like both, you know.
Okay. So the clearly here for what we gather from this article is that the La Pd. They are trying to do exactly what China is doing. I mean they but they don't obviously don't compare to China, or anything but like. But the idea is pretty much the same. So those control rooms that you see that that she showed in her article, which is right in front of you.
It's actually exactly what we have in China.
and and I visit them in Chinese exactly like that. I mean it's just data coming from everywhere, and you can track anywhere in the city you can like, you know. Use this screen. You can like touch, and you can or you can. Sometimes there's joysticks. It depends sometimes on the computer. It has all sorts of technologies in China, but the the same in the United States, probably. So you can zoom in and you can. So you let me see right now let me see the camera on white, as you know, right in front of our Vc. For example. Then boom!
There! You can see everything that's happening, and you can zoom in and you can capture people's face and you can process them and see who their family tree is. I mean, China is amazing. I mean, you want to study policing
and and and big data. China is the way to go, although I don't recommend you going to China to do that right now, but anyways.
okay. So having said that, let's so, she's she's concerned with this question here that I already I gave to you right now, I would like to take a moment and think about this.
Okay. So we have big data
and is big data changing the way that we police people is it? Is it is big data changing.
listening.
Which police surveillance is it household?
I don't want you guys to go ahead and see my my slides. I just would like you guys, if I can. I wish we had an in person class, you know, like I how I mean, how how I mean, do you think
I mean? Probably you? We don't know much about what's going on here in Canada.
because first Canada is lagging behind in that kind of policing, but which is good and bad at the same time. But, anyways, but how would you guys think
that that big there is changing policing?
How would you? What what would you say if you had to, you know? Get your brains
working, you know. How would you? What do you think? What is going on, you know.
So Joy saying, Look what big data being that there is less need for police officers roaming around the city. Certainly, certainly, and there is more joy
doesn't mean that perhaps we can target
because we can use big data to know where the crime is, and then we can actually target. Yes, there he is, you know. So it it is a. Yes, you know. The answer is yes, so we could. You know that's exactly what's happening in. La! So you as an officer, you don't have. You don't spend a lot of like kind of
dead time like looking at places where there is no crime. Actually, you're gonna do target kind of deployment. That's how they call it target deployment, right? So
exactly career exactly a lot of non non non-human error. Of course, in another problem.
Then we're going to discuss here. I mean the the the data Doesn't Doesn't provide. I mean, you. You have very limited context, right. So they see me. They profile me, or they see my car parked somewhere where usually it's like a drug dealer, and then they come to me because they think that from part in that spot they have data.
fast data of the people who parked in there, and all the people who parked in that spot if they are drug dealers. That means that me, too. And then that means that the police is gonna come to me. So a lot of a lot of space for mistakes. Jenna, here's saying more, and this month exactly more anticipation.
Exactly. People one of the if I can tell you in a nutshell, one of the biggest favors.
and I don't know if it's good or bad, because it's both it. It it can be bad and good. It depends for? Who? What party you're talking about, like what kind of what? What part is not like political party like? What? Which person you're talking about right like, but
one of the problems here is that it's predictive. It's it's it's policing based on on prediction.
So it's predictive.
So the the kinds of policing Jen is exactly what you're saying. You don't wait until something happened. You act before, and that is problematic. People that's problematic.
because let's suppose that you know just to give a stupid example. Let's suppose that I I always, you know, I always buy. Let's say sociology, books on on, on on Amazon, and then Amazon.
like Amazon, Amazon, like, sees me as a sociology person, as a sociologist.
and all the like. The the advertisements and the suggestions. They are for sociology, because that prediction. Think with me that predictions based on what? On future behavior?
No, that prediction is based on best behavior. So you know. So I go on Amazon. And then there's a bunch of sociology books. But let's but I am more than that. I'm also interested in criminology. I'm also interested in math and statistics. I'm. Also so. But, like Amazon Doesn't, know that because you know the prediction that they have is based on paths, and in the past I have never bought those things
in their into your website. So they don't know right? So so that's the problem it will be. I don't know. I'm trying to show you guys here that like. And I really like Jenna's comment, because.
like there is a philosophical debate behind that.
So it's just about the better example that. Suppose you guys are, you know, like some one of the people. This is just my example. Okay, like, let's suppose all of us we are terrible in school. Okay, we all our Gpa is just like it sucks
it, sucks Marcella. Okay, Great. So but I want to change. And I actually manage to change. Actually, I have a lot of people in my when I look back at all the almost 5,000 people that I have thought
I have a lot of people that they're excellent. Excellent. I have top notch students or people right? They don't. I'd like to systems because I students like it gives you a box, but I have top notch people who take my courses.
and and some of them like they. They didn't do very well in school, but they were amazing.
They were like super smart, super analytical super. You know the best, and I also have had students that they, their gpa is just like, and They're not that great to be honest
like like not exciting. It's not like, you know, the comments and everything is not so exciting. Right? So it's like not. I mean Everybody's great somewhere. But, like you guys, get what i'm saying right? So it's like. So, anyway. So let's suppose that your your future life in school. Let's suppose that your first 2 years they were terrible.
And then i'm gonna predict. If I apply some software, it's gonna predict that you're terrible. But you're in, but you know you have the potential to not be terrible.
and and that you were terrible because you had to work, or whatever, or because you didn't have time, or because you were going through, You know, a major depression, or you were going through troubles or whatever that is right like. So. But that doesn't mean that you know you're gonna. So that's the problem of prediction you make like the sal like big data is based on it's past people
is not future.
and that's I mean, i'm saying those things. I'm getting excited here because i'd like you to think about what i'm saying. Okay.
and in the impact of kind of stopping someone based on best behavior that can be very problematic.
right like. And then, if you agree, another thing that I wanna say is that
people talk a lot about. I see a lot of advertisements and and and and like in articles on the media, especially like news media about like artificial intelligence. And and and there's a lot of people writing who like, you know, artificial intelligence is going to be like better than human. It can be better than human. And I I look those sounds like
I don't know. I'm not very sure. I don't think that's actually possible, because we?
That's the thing. We humans. We are extremely powerful, and I like to call this divine, but not not in the religious sense, but it's almost like we have this divine power that we can. We can create new things.
We always can create something new. I mean, just look at the technologies and look at. You know, technological history and all the things that we have created in the past, like, let's say, 100 years, so we can create amazing things. This is our part of our nature as humans. But our future intelligence
is is always lagging behind it. It it it will be always like behind. It can't like the way that it's set up in a way that I mean for us to set up that we we we as human, when we set up. You know, some sort of artificial intelligence we do, based on the past, not in the future.
So there is a relationship with time and space that artificial intelligence cannot, cannot, or artificial intelligence cannot bridge you cannot, you know I don't know I i'd like to hear from you folks. Actually, I know this is kind of a little crazy thing. But I like you to think about this.
So
Yeah. So, Janet, because after that they anticipate. They predict Are they right. Hmm. 80 85% of the time. Yes, but never a 100% never. And they're like, you know, their opportunity is for mistakes in there.
So Kathleen here. It intensifies policing and surveillance definitely. I remember in my Msd. Class
masters, Ms: T Sorry, guys, I i'm not very good. If those tell me what that is it must it? It was mentioned that police came to to house. There's something here that doesn't read me. Okay to a house of our writers since he was searching so much about.
Yeah.
Well, you guys saw, I mean, you know, I talked to someone all over offs hour or the other day. I mean that example that I gave you guys from BBC. News about this guy in La. By the way, la.
this guy he sent like a a nation doesn't class this this little by he had like a a son. His son, little baby had something on his penis.
and then, like the the father like to to help, you know they did. He took a lot of pictures from like his voice Penis, so he could send that to the doctor, because you know, it's all
on the Internet. Now you have like a doctor that is like a zoom call. So he said he use his gmail to send those pictures over. And then he got caught by the by Google and Google reported him to the police.
and it became a nightmare. His life, like as a kind of file. I mean he was one of the the file people. It's a it's a you know, but that destroyed his life for for a little bit, and later he eventually got got cleared. But Google never returned his account.
He was flagged forever in, not only flat, but then forever. You know as a potential pedal file. Can you imagine?
I mean So
so that that's exactly the example that Kathleen here is saying data doesn't it doesn't provide the context people. A lot of it is context. So you guys have to remember this from this last forever. I mean the thing with this hypervisibility that we have is that it's it's a big ready. It is a big Us situation.
On one hand you have hyper visibility. You can see everything. On the other hand, it's really easy to get a snapshot of that
and take it out of context, and that can be used right like you know. What i'm saying here applies to a lot of things, really a question. Big data I have to, you know. Policing, you know, inspired by by by big data. It applies for, you know, like even how we use social media. You know it doesn't you know it's it's it's it's ambiguous. It gives visibility. On one hand, on the other hand.
it takes away from the call. It takes away. It takes a context away right like
in the bias and all those things that agreed in media. Okay, okay, media class. Okay, I got it. Okay. So people.
So here, let's see the argument. So the arguments exactly what you guys are saying, Look, the argument is exactly what some of you put on the chat. E: Very easy argument amplifies like so big data amplifies
like surveillance. Pry over here. What I mean is like prior shoot. I I please fix fix this slide for me on your notes. Big data amplifies what amplify surveillance
like it's: J. Like what I mean here is like Ge. It's different than old surveillance, or like low tech surveillance, or the traditional surveillance that is not plugged, and we got to remember that the difference between a data set surveillance and a data set
and big data is that in big data we have several data sets automated right like the you. They're plugged together, and they work in a automated way so that you create and they feed.
They feed, you know, automated away. So it's like it's kind of streaming all the time that data. So in producing reports continuously, so that's what big data is right. It's not just like one data set, but a bunch of data set all connected together in a platform in that platform, you know, and that that those like sources of data, feeding the platform
or continuously and creating report continuously. Okay.
So
so let's see here. Big data is also associated with the fundamental transformation and surveillance activities. Yes, it changes the way you do surveillance, because a lot of the way that we do surveillance think with me
it it we rely on our discretionary discretionary power a lot. So we look at people we look at the context, but when we have big data like we don't really it, it almost like it kind of dispatches us from context. So some of the officers.
police officers from Los Angeles in her article in Sarah's article, they say, oh, you know I don't like this, or I don't like that, because it almost like takes away my my my power as a police officer it did did kill me. It takes away my skills
right like it's almost like you know. Whoa, there is this artificial intelligence, or there is this like
chat? Whatever Gd: Whatever you guys told me I forgot the name. Now there's this chat thing that answers it like it is. It? Is this kind of
you know, or rock cool that chain oracle? Is that that answers every question that takes away the the teachers power, and that's why the teachers don't like it. Well, I like it. I mean, I like it, those kinds of things, but like. But you know people could. They want to ban it? And you don't want to to kind of. Think of ways that you can actually use that stuff in in the favor of society, right? So it's like it's the kind of the same thing. So a lot of officers see, I don't like this thing because it takes away My! You know my ability to think it takes away my ability to make decisions. It makes the decisions for me.
So so that changes the way that you, as a surveillance agent, someone who does the surveillance the way that you act so let's go deeper here. So look.
they are like they like those are broad like what? I just.
Oh, you! It's just big things. She actually in a very organized way, she broke
her findings into 5 topics. So the first one that she's gonna say is that that, like you know, law enforcement, you know, like supplements like the officers. Like all that, the big data with like law, enforcement some supplements the officers discretionary power.
It it makes it more quantified. So I think you should highlight the word 25 in here. So essentially big data makes your work. So now, just for this class, all of you guys are going to be police officers, so pretend you are police officer. So you have big data. It makes your work much more quantified. So you know I am going to go in there. I am going to patrol that area because it says here on my report that the crime rate, like there is higher.
Or it says here that you know that right now in that area there is a lot of like a park, a car plates that are. You know that they are related to people who has who people who have stolen cars. So i'm going to control. So you have an argument, a very kind of, you know. Boom, you have an argument, so
it makes it very quantifiable.
and usually like that Argument has to do with like risk. So it's this quantification of risk
we've talked about that ages that go in this course, like when they talk about what they're going to see, and this rationality that we have it makes it very rare and rational. Right? So another thing that she says number 2, it's about brick predictive policing, which is exactly what Jenna. Right like it, Jenna. Yeah, I think, was Jen, who said that in the chat
it, you know you can predict but people
it's okay, Marcel. But how would, what would be the difference? The difference would be reactive. Our police people mo like 90% of the of the police services in the world. They are reactive. It goes like this: I phone 9, 1, one and 9 1 One respond to something.
of course. But Marcella, a police car. They do patrol. Yes, they do, and that would be more like like more, not a proactive. It's not really predictive. It's on the for it. It has a little bit of prediction, I mean, because a police police person will say, Look, I'm gonna patrol that specific air
from past that the you know. So he's predicting, or they are predicting. She's predicting right like. But it's much more the policing that we have as much more, you know, like, you know, like reactive than anything else. So
So this is something for you to to think about. If you you work someone, you're gonna work your
you know you're gonna be a lawyer, or you're gonna be a criminal lawyer, or, you know, work with crime. You're gonna work with like public safety in the government making policies, whatever that is that you guys will do in your life. You gotta be aware of that. Okay, should I, you know, push for more predictive policing or or more reactive policing, and both they have pros and cons right like. But the trend, the trend in the world is predictive policing right? So that's the trend.
Another thing here is that so?
There is a lot of like, you know, systems that they are. They are alert, based.
So they just you know the system goes like, okay, whenever you know that the cameras are capturing information from the streets, and then whatever. Whenever there is a specific situation which is inside of the algorithm it's described mathematically in the algorithm You know that system triggers an alarm. So okay, there's a problem here, right? So that's that's exactly what you know what what happens.
So so you know. So, people, and this is I. I want to take it like to see something else more about Number 3.
The way that we have in kind of old surveillance is we run a query when I say, run a query. You guys know what i'm talking about right like it's just like you. You tab you late some data. You cross something with something you say. Okay.
find me this, or you know we do that in the we do that on Well, in statistics I do that all the time we do that, even like in a you know. In a word, document you can control. Search that idea like control searching. You know those things. They this is like running a query. That's what it is like from the from the technical perspective.
So this is old policing, new policing.
You don't run queries. What you do in new policing is
There's no need for that, because it's big data. So big data is you just set up. You set up that, you know. Okay, I want to have reports on this and that. And I want those reports to be, you know, every hour or so there is not, and I I want to set. I want to mathematically set. Whenever this situation here happens, you know
you're gonna sound the alarm. And then that's gonna tell me. Look, you know. So that's how it works. So this is Major, this like I I kind of recommend you keep that in mind. So the difference between old surveillance or kind of still digital, all digital surveillance and and big data is like query versus, you know, like automated kind of you know.
like of the feed. Is this clear for you guys? I don't know if you if you think about that, that often is this clear? I mean.
so
keywords for you risk
predictive, you know. Query versus systematic.
Okay, those are or automated right? Those are key words for you to kind of remember, because those words they describe the influence of big data on policing folks. Are you guys there.
I'm just checking, because sometimes I get that weird feeling everything shut down. I'm talking to the walls here, and I I went crazy, you know, like I I really have those feelings like
It's so funny like, okay, you are there. And then I I need something empirical, such as like, you know. Okay. So you your cat. Okay? Nice to put a picture of your cat on on our chat so we can see that we can see the cat.
Okay, people they all
for, and that is extremely important, Some of you you have already raised this topic with. Oh, I let's see. Come on.
Well look at this people oh, so cute!
I I love animals people. I love it, you know. I don't have any right now. But
oh, that's really nice. But thank you very much.
Okay. So folks So, anyways, like the threshold. And that's the problem. Because with big data, you have data from multiple sources, you're going to see that empirically
flowing.
and then, like even like you know, like you know. Oh, well, we're gonna talk about their like L. A. Pd. In a second. But like in China, for example. Now, like even data from like your like, your cell phone like they in China, they don't have like they don't use Whatsapp.
What they use in China is, we chat. It's a little application, an app called we chat, and we chat is like a a wallet. It has all sorts of functions. It's a multi function thing, right? So I believe you guys are you heard about? We chat right? If not just kind of you know. Take a little Google
and just Google. I'm going to write you here for you folks. Just Google. We chat and then app.
and then you're going to see what it does. It's like. It's a multi-function function thing. So in China, like big data for policing is set up in a way that it gets even data from wechat.
So imagine I mean the police being able to see what you have on your cell. Phone
Isn't: that crazy. Yeah, but that's that's how. So that's called big data. And and the problem here, I mean China is a dictatorship and everything. But the problem is, we are far from that reality here in Canada or the Us. But the problem is that you know the threshold for you to include data and keep that data in in that
platform that has all sorts of data, you know, and that feeds policing. It's easier. It's like, you know, people don't even realize. Oh, there's this data here, you know, like, and that is being used in policing. So
not all of that data is admissible to court a lot of that data is actually not admissible to court in case there is a court case. However, that helps the police officer to make a decision.
So you know, so it's. It's extremely problematic.
So look and here the number 5. This is the creep function that we talked about the other day, right like. So this is
it function?
Okay, so big. Why? Because, like you collect the data for one purpose, and all of a sudden, you are using that data for another purpose. So it's what surveillance we call create function. Okay, so it's extremely problematic. So let's see what she actually so here
she gives. She gives us this little table which I really liked. I really like that. I found that was very interesting. Here. Look migration of traditional policing to big data policing.
I can't see the bottom here, but like that's what it's in there. So look at this. So in terms of like this is traditional surveillance. This is big data surveillance. So traditional surveillance. You have much more risk assessment more. It's discretionary. It's according to you know the opinion and decision of the law enforcement agent, whereas you know, like you know, like in big big data is kind of moving away from this traditional look. If you look at the chart.
In her opinion, big data as is right now. It's. It's not even like fully developed yet, because you would have the potential to get to this side of the but no, it's still here. So she believes that you get even much more quantified. So what we had before was this
power. Now what we have is quantified risk assessment in terms of explanatory analytics.
the All to events. And now what we have is predictive analytics. So I like this chart because it gives you a summary of the article, you know. Query: based information versus alert, based information, moderate, moderate inclusion, threshold, very low inclusion, threat, threshold.
and then
disparate data and integrate the data. So here, like you have a bunch of like data, different data sets, like what hegery in his article called discrete discrete data sets.
And with big data, everything is integrated feeding automatically into this platform. Right? So I don't know I found this very kind of oh, this is nice, because it kind of gives you okay, what is the difference between, you know, like olds like old sir, Old High tech surveillance and and new high tech surveillance, like big data, right like.
So here, people.
So let's let's give. Let's see some examples, you know. So the the top number one here is this quantification of individual risk. Okay, which is, speaks to this first line here.
Okay, so it's like this risk here being quantified.
So how does that work? So in her article we learned that the officers. They get like data from several sources, and they come up with a list
of chronic offenders
again. Now you're going to put yourself yourselves in the shoes of an offender.
So again, let's suppose that you move in the gear.
Okay, you live in the Ghetto, and then the police officer. if they have a list with. You know the potential names that are names that are chronicle founders, and then they see you
and and like, and they they they they can see your car plate. They have that we're gonna talk about that sharply. They have that, you know, like a technology to read car plates. So you know they have this list, and this list is plugged
also to the platform. The platform has the car plate that feeds into the platform, so
i'm. Driving
by the Ghetto, because the gear is where you know the the the data says that i'm gonna find a lot of chronic offenders. And then I I am driving the Ghetto, and then my my technology scans the environment and grabs your plate.
And indeed, indeed you are. You were a chronic offender. and let's suppose that you are out on on probation now, and you're not supposed to be to to be out
and about after 90'clock P. M. And let's suppose that you are out and about because you are said
needed some mad scene, and you went to buy. You drove down, you know, to buy something because there was an emergency. The police will catch you, so that technology will allow the police to catch you and stop you and send you back to prison.
Oh, yeah, the person broke the law. Yeah. Broke There there is. There is a breach of probation. but on the flip side that person was like, you know.
What can you do? Your son is he, or something is happening, and you had to kind of
maybe it wasn't big. It was bad. Maybe you were out because you wanted to buy drugs. But but let's suppose it was not the case. and then you got caught. So
so you see, like. So that big the problem here, I mean, it has upsides to that technology. But the downside
here's just like it creates a lot of inequalities in the way that you are. You know you are policing people
right like so in in and it doesn't really, you know. I mean
it's easy to kind of. You know you. You scan the environment, and then you easily. You just catch everyone. It's so. Even in the article one. there's a talk about all those sorts of technologies. It's just like
fishing with a big net. I kind of like that kind of it's like That's that's what it is. You're fishing for a huge net.
Of course you're you're gonna find people right like, and so it gets it gets complex right? So
so the officers, so they they do those, you know the list? They have a list on their car and the computers in their cars, and they can also print that list.
and you know, and then they do a stretch fight surveillance, so like they kind of okay. Now, I I know that here's more danger. Here's more dangerous. Here's less dangerous. So they create this, like, you know, Risk kind of a hierarchy, and they will tackle that. And again, is this useful? It's from the surveillance perspective. Wonderful.
But the question is. is it really worth it to be after
like because a lot of that happens with petty crimes, right like. Is it really worth it.
or you know. And how about the other crimes that's happening? Society? I mean. Yeah. So anyways, I think that I mean.
we have to cry. I mean, we have to stop crime and and and and take it seriously. But like, we also need to consider that. I mean, okay, we have all this technology is this actually cost effective? Because I mean, okay, you are sending someone down to like, because this person, you know, you got that person breaching probation for some stupid thing.
Wasn't that the person was fighting? No, it was just like oh, you you were out, for you know it was like 8, 50, or it was like 9 15, and you were supposed to be home by 9 in your, you know, like
so complex. So
the second point that she makes, you know, this shift from reactive, from like reactive to predictive. And here I would like you guys to remember this because i'm going to ask that on the exam there is the software called breadpole.
Okay.
So so what it happened is this software. He has this, this Geo processing feature with Gis, and whenever there is a crime
like, you know, whoever is like monitoring the software.
what's a.in there? And and then I mean.
And then that becomes that past data becomes, you know, a technology to print or to to predict the future. So officers in the they use spread poll so they can map the entire city of La, and they know exactly where to go. Okay, because they they see the crime rates right so.
And and they receive a print of of the city before they start of their shift, and then they are encouraged to drive around those specific areas. It's almost like they divide. They come together like a class
like a group, and it's okay, you know. Matthew Jenna and and and Joey. You guys go on the north side. Marcella and and caramir, and and whoever goes on the south side right like. So kind of we make that, and that is called predictive deployment, As I said
so. And then again in the officers they don't like not all officers. They like that because they think that that software is kind of diskilling them. Okay, so it's taking away to your discretionary powers because you have to remember law enforcement people.
Discretionary power is extremely important in in law enforcement. It's like you know, you making your decision and and like you interpreting the situation. That's extremely important. So big data take some things away. So so you know, if you have time there, Google the spread full.
And before I go I want to show you something on the Internet, Hold on, i'm going to switch my screen. Here.
Are you guys there Still, I want to show you this thing. There's something that I wanna
that meant them 5 min.
This thing people, is extremely like what i'm talking what? I'm telling you guys, here
we in Canada. We are not so advanced yet. But
have you ever seen this website?
Oh.
how do I. Okay, this is it so? Have you ever seen this website?
You to tell me on the chat? It's called Neighborhood Crime Mapping People. Are you guys there. Yes, he has no Okay. Great. Oh, okay. Why, why were you looking at it, Macy?
I'm curious. I mean, if we can share, of course.
Yeah. So, people. So this is actually so. It's what it's nice, and I usually let me just see, because I haven't used this. No, quite a while. I just look neighborhood, crime mapping.
and then you'll come in here. Let me see. I'm going to save to port. Let's see what they don't want to show you how it works within a second. Just where is it?
Look at this people, and they keep up dating. Okay, because now it's more kind of high tech than than 2 years ago. So here, let's suppose we are on.
Let's suppose we are on where? Let me see the you neighborhood my neighborhood, old traffic on
Hold?
Oh, no, it has to be like official name.
Let's just make this is easier. Instead of selecting. So look, let's get the U. Of a area okay, or even here, old straw.
So this is it, right? So that's where I live.
And then here you can see all you can put a a date like let's put, like, you know, last since the beginning of the month, until the day of today.
and and then here
I can see all this stuff, right? Oh, let me see. You know. Usually they stop that I when i'm i'm gonna to rent a place or i'm gonna know, or if I have to go somewhere at night. I usually look at sexual assault, so let me see this one here.
Oh, they took it away. Success
funny!
They lump it, I think, with a salt, is it? It may just be under assault now.
Yeah, but this is bad. This is because it doesn't like it's it. There's a very distinct difference between
No. But but look, yeah, this is bad. This is terrible. People, and I believe that they are doing that because they don't want to freak people out, because I mean I I haven't checked this website in 2 years, and I remember that I mean you know what he didn't have this nice make up that he has right now. He was more kind of old kind of stuff.
but he had like sex sex sexual assault, and I used to check on it. Because okay, let's just see a sound. So look at this people. So you see, and also the dots they used to be call caller. Now they are not
so. So let's see how it works now.
Yeah, if they made it harder to to to to search, you know. Let's see Click here for more information.
Yeah, they change it really bad, you know. They're not giving us. Oh, here.
look! Personal violence, reported October, whatever personal violence that sound, and then there they give the intersection
before you should be better. You You talk, I i'm listening
disappointment. Anybody wants to talk.
No.
I here to Mike. Someone's Mike. Okay. So cute. Let me see.
Okay, okay for your claim. Okay, okay. So people. This
I thought, I remember. Yeah, exactly. It was scholar and everything. So they change it. But anyways. but this bought the form.
I mean, this is the first step Creating a map of crimes is the first step
towards building big data in policing. It's the first first to the first baby step, because we need to kind of it. It's very geographical right like so for people who are into geography, I mean, there's a lot of intersections between surveillance, knowledge and geograph. And here it is. You can see, because it's like
so in, and I I know that i'm going to show you that later. But there is a a colleague of mine from the
Turkish G. And she disappeared. I don't know what she's doing right now, but but she did a very wonderful. She built a model to predict a murder and attempted murder in Edmonton. And she used like this data, this data set.
and she revived that she made it even better, but also looking at past crimes, which is, which is the norm right like. But anyways, I wanted to show you that. So now you know.
and i'm sad now that they are not doing as good as a job as they used to do. Let me see, do you guys see my slides? Because sometimes I don't know if you see my lines. Oh, share screen. Not yet. Okay. Here. Now you're gonna see it.
So, anyway. So that's why I showed you that that because that's going to stick to your mind so essentially people. you know California, Where is this?
Well, sometimes I I despise the zoom thing because there's like this bar that keeps disturbing me.
I think I'm getting old people, you know. I sound like my my parents, my mom.
Okay, okay, good. So this like the thing with California has a lot of start ups like startups for technology. And so this company
did this spread Paul thing, using data from the police and they create. They they, you know, they they organize, they they revamped. And even, like FBI CIA, a lot of like law enforcement agencies in the United States. They use data from this company.
So, anyway, so but that originally they built that based off
police data in Canada. By the way, we don't have anything like that. So if you guys want to start a business, you should, you know, like, if you are into criminology, geography, if you know, like about like, you know, gis like mapping and stuff like that. I mean go for it because there is there. Would that? That's good. I I can. I'm a 100% sure that's gonna make you reach. I mean, you know. So
so, anyways, so that that so we talked about this. So that's number 3 people. The query thing there is this software called a. L. Pr.
I don't think that we have that in Canada yet.
I've heard of people of the area Rcmp: having them that's offer. But I don't think that's like the the like. The municipal police they have that I don't know. Do you guys know, if they admit to police. For example, if they can read your car plate
like from afar people.
Do you guys know
because I mean you, you Perhaps you not, because you you have more networks, and you deny right. So you you here
folks, are, you guys there?
I believe they don't. I believe that only like their Cnp. Has that technology. I don't think that police has. But let me explain how this works. So
in in the United States, in many jurisdictions, including in the in the Los Angeles. So the police cars, the police vehicles. They have this, like, you know, like computer like this technology, this like little device in their dashboard
that which it works like a camera, and that stuff can scan the environment.
So when you're driving, you are a police person you are. You are like driving it. You don't have to skin anything. The computer does it for you, right like the device does it for you.
and it's just like fishing with a big net. And and then, like all those plates that is within that visibility scope
that gets into your computer and automatically your computer, the platform that the police has process that, and then so that suppose I'm driving, and then there is like, you know. So and so with a drug dealer drives by and crosses. My, you know my my scan kind of environment. And then the computer we go.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Marcel, I stop stop there is there, you know, look for, and immediately that they like. This is like, not on scans, the the license. But if they always look for you know it's a it's a black Ford 19, whatever, you know. License plate whatever. And this car has been stolen in 19, you know, like it gives you the entire like. You know
the whole package. You have everything you know everything about the car, and
this car was bought by, you know, Marcell, and then Matthew, and then Jenna, and then you know so and so and then. So it gives you everything. So imagine people. This is a lot of data.
because let's suppose that I sold the C. Or I let's suppose I bought the car that was stolen? I did not know. I I i'm honest here.
I didn't know, but I get flagged. I get trapped in that system in that, you know technology. So that's what they doing there. So so this is a. So now I think now we kind of when I say there is no need to like. Do the traditional police
like they have to stop me, and they have to ask for mine. They they pull me, they.
you know they take my license. They they take my license to their car. They run my license, they look for something, for I know, like, you know, for an a a warrant, or for something right like No. Here you don't need to stop the person. So let's think
for the from the police perspective.
They don't like it on on one side, but on the some of them they might not like it.
but it's much more safer right like you don't have to actually stop someone. And you know, especially like in countries where you can have guns and and stuff like that. So you don't have to kind of approach. You don't know if the person's high on something, so it's safer for the police officer. Yeah, Some police officers don't like it, and yet it makes policing much more effective and much more like, you know, like you don't, it's quicker, and but on the flip side again. Maybe you know you are being stopped because you don't even know that you, You know you are driving your uncles.
you know. car to to go for the grocery shopping because your car is in the mechanic, and then you get you get. You get flagged. It, you know, because of the car, and then you you get flagged together because the police will eventually stop you and and ask for your license, and then you know your license number is going to be compounded with the you know a car plate that has been stolen. I mean.
try to do that.
Try it to kind of get, you know, to explain that actually what it looks like. It's not what it looks like, right? So it's like
chaotic right like this tries your life. So so. But this is very common. And I see this happening. I believe, like in China. This is already happening because they also have that kind of technology and in and in Canada. I know that the Rcmp. Has it.
And I don't know how how like widely is it that is used. And in fact, that is one of the problems.
We have a lot of the theory on surveillance.
But our empirical knowledge of surveillance is, is very it? It's still like very small. And that's that. She says that in the art which says, like my motivation.
to go and and and and do this kind of work. Ethnographic work at at Los Angeles is that I mean, we don't really have a lot of things. We don't know exactly how the surveillance is like hitting the ground right like so. And here, like the officers, they also have like feeds. You know
our our Ss. Feeds, like, you know, just like you know it kind of again.
They use the car. The car plate like to kind of like they. It's all connected. So okay, i'm scanning the car plate. And then there is. Oh, you know this car is tied to this name
like let's say, this is like, you know, this car plate side to Marcella, and Marcella has a pending, you know, issue with the with the courts, so stop her and and arrest her.
And and again I don't even have to do any work. I mean it's all kind of integrated, right like. So let's see what else
so lower
database inclusion threshold. So here is another problem: the police people in Canada, the Us. Everywhere. The police has always capped
kind of set on the side of all the people that they stop
like. They stop, and you know they they they check and and you know, and like it's called, usually stop and first, right like they they're set, so that every police has that. But that is not like legal to have to keep that. I mean, you know it's kind of a gray area, but I mean that data is not really admissible to port, and you shouldn't be keeping that data. There's nothing that you know for for you to do that, except that if you're going to profile people. It's not the case.
but the police. They have always kept that. And
and but with with that, with the
big data technology, you're keeping data of everything. So you're keeping those those like, you know, those reports on okay cars versus a car owners versus versus warrant versus, you know, like like connected with the space. So she gives example in in the article of this, like, you know, like parking spaces, you can actually like the technology the police has in Los Angeles. I'll ask for you to tag and and PIN
people to places so like. So you know you like automatically, so like you know you. You can like, create a report on all those, a series of license plates, and everywhere that those license license plates have been seen.
and then you can cross that automatically with, like, you know, your information on, on, on, on the crimes, and like the the geographical, like the the you know, the you can cross that with Fred Paul. Okay. So you can see where you know the like, the the mapping part. So it's like.
So it it it gets really kind of, you know. It gets really
like uncontrollable, you know, for for for civilians, for us.
so anyways, and even like it, look like the example that she gives about the car. They take not only the the plates, but also this all the surrounding license place.
you know. Like it's, it can be really crazy like you like uncontrollable. So she has this example here of, like, you know, like just for using this like license plate technology. So you know that this is a bad guy. Let's call it like this is the target, so you can see you can kind of track his car, and you can see, and through his license you can track everybody that he's hanging out with. So you can use that, you know car license as a tracker kind of, you know.
because you connect, you see, like you, you tag, you know who has been in that car, who you know, with, who who has on that car with the places where people are, so you can very quickly. You can. I mean it doesn't get as as quick as in China like.
but fairly quick. You can pinpoint someone, and you can see all the web of relationships surrounding that person, especially because if we think in North America
a car is a very important. Everybody has a car right like I mean, Of course, some people don't, but like, but most people have a car, so so it's like, you know, so that, like
tagging that to car it, it's it's smart. Let's put that way, you know, because everybody has, so you can very quickly. You know, tag everyone. So
so number 5 people.
So there is this like volunteer, okay, volunteer or volunteer. So this is this is actually the platform where everything gets integrated. So we have. So we're talking about different services.
Different kind of, you know. Service like the part. The car plate is one, you know, the the, the
the police, the predictive police is another one. The mapping is another one, but you know there is a spot of
Fl. All the dating there you can set up reports. You can set up whatever kinds of things that you want to be generated automatically. Okay. So so that's it. So those are the tools that like that that the police has in lapd, you know, like the the lapd has, so that that's pretty much, you know. So that means what people, when we look at all of that. Okay. So watch, Marcel. What do we do?
We got to think about the inequality, right? Because I mean if I live. If I am an honest person, I have never broken the law. I don't have anything to do with the criminal justice, but I live in a poor area
which has a lot of crimes, because usually apartments in poor areas, they tend to be cheaper right like where we apartments, where you know there's a lot of crime, so nobody wants to rent. It's only for the people who don't really have the money to rent, and then they go in renting there, so I suppose I rent something in a very poor area, because, you know, I don't really have money. I am very young. I'm just i'm just like, you know, I've just finished the U. Of a. I moved to Los Angeles. I don't really have the money to spend. I found the job. The job doesn't pay very well, you know.
and i'm living there. But like you're going to be a target. So you're just by virtue of policing your license plate. It's going to be collected every day from some police car, you know, and you're They're going to be consulted continually, and then, like running you through their computers. And again.
maybe no problem. Because you don't, you don't have any dealings with anybody. You're good.
But eventually that suppose that you know you are seen with someone, or or you take an over with someone who I mean, you know something like something can put you in a situation where you know you're caught in this like web of information, and you're flagged. And then again for you to undo that
it's gonna take a lot of paperwork a lot of, but the most important thing, because it is so geographical. And that's why I took the time to open the map for Edmonton, because it is so geographical and geography intersect with everything that we are, I mean, especially where we live
and where we live has to be money, so it becomes, it becomes very unequal from the money perspective. Right? So the poor you are, the more the more chances you have of of of getting caught for something or getting the mute of something right? So
And then what you guys said, and she goes okay. Now, what we have is much more surveillance.
and our data is being stored in there like pretty much forever, because the ability to to keep the storage is now has. I mean, you know you have clouds. You have this and that, I mean you can keep like the the amount of data that we can keep is just like enormous. It's almost like infinite, so
you know. So it's going to be there forever. So you did something stupid 10 years ago that that's gonna come up right like if I I mean. luckily for me and Greer right like for us, like when we we used to do something stupid like silly things. I mean, we didn't have that technology. But for you guys.
or for even if people were like now teenagers. Now, if they do anything stupid today that's gonna that's gonna being there forever forever, right like. So
that's the it becomes very generational to, you know. Sorry, Grier, I put you on the spot here, you know. Well you you are the one who told me that you know you. You You saw life before before
you know the the the smartphone getting popular. So you know, anyways, people. I'm joking here with you, but like so. And then there is a function creep like right? So it's like this idea that I mean and and think about it, people, if you know.
you know, you know, if you, if you took this class this this today's lecture and let's suppose you were extremely tax, savvy. and and you live in La, and you know, or even if you live in that meeting and you have a business you're gonna try to collect as much data as you can from whatever business. So you can sell that data.
you know, to those companies that are providing services to the police, or even you can, you know, find a way that you're gonna find some find a way to a novel way to gather data and create a create a data set that's going to be fat is fed into a big data, right? So it's like.
So you can't like, you know. So the problem here is that you we put like data
people's
information inside of the money logic, because I mean, you know, there's an industry behind this this data, those services
they don't like the the that the
license plate service it doesn't come for free. I mean. You have to pay the police space for that, right? So there's a whole industry collecting data on us, and that makes that. You know the policies that we're about to to approve in Canada that really limits the the ability of organizations to collect your data, our data. It makes that those those laws extremely important.
because otherwise it would be any person kind of start to create data sets, and you know and and sell, and and then use that somehow, and use that for money you can. I mean, this is already happening, but it can get even much worse right? Like much, much, much worse. So so so, anyways, so people comments, questions anything you want to say.
folks. I don't know I found. I find this.
I I really like this article because it's the best people You're not gonna find any other article that actually dissects the way that we that the the way that the police is using big data you're not gonna find. I bet a $100 go find and bring me something better, and I pay you. You're not gonna find, you know, like this is the best scientific thing collected in a way that I I found her very. Her conclusions are very easy. Okay, it's more data.
you know, and it's it changed the scope and it changed a little bit like, you know, like in terms of it's scratch like the discretion and everything. But you know. But but but the what is beautiful all her her, her her article is that she actually shows how that you know you're gonna see a lot of quotes from the law enforcement. And you know, police officers and everything. So
any questions anything. If not, I'm going to wrap up here, and I don't want to start anything new. because
next class people i'm gonna do a pretty recorded lecture. So I wanna like, I want to start and finish like you know, one topic. I don't wanna like, have stuff like lingering around. So so you're gonna stop here and and and unfortunately, I will have I told you guys that I was confused about when
my my Tuesday class it's gonna be pre-recorded. Okay, the Tuesday one. So i'm sorry about it. I I don't like for recording classes. But but sometimes I have to do it, and that's why
I I You know I the courses online, right like, so I can I Sometimes I need to be away.
But but anyways, people is that okay? Can we go. And are you guys okay? So I wish you folks a great day. You take care of yourselves, and and that's it for today and look
ask around and tell me. You know, if the police here I'm gonna also ask. I'm gonna actually to ask the police if they have that. But about like the the license plate.
You guys take care of people. Stay. Well, okay. If you have any questions for me, just stay on the line.
